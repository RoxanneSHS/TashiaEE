@0 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Tashia forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right...  Amaunator's idol has restored Tashia not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from her, as well.~

@1 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Tashia into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had her.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost her.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan...~

@2 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Tashia.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@3    = ~Snookums? Pookie? Sweatheart? Darling? Hmm...~
@4    = ~Tashia, get your ass in gear. Your musings put us all in danger.~
@5    = ~What's going on, Tashia?~
@6    = ~Well, excuse me. I will be sure to ask your permission before I do anything else.~
@7    = ~Oh, it's nothing really... I was just thinking of what kinda endearment you would like. For some reason, though, I don't think sugarpie would fit you, but what do you think of... darling?~
@8    = ~You can call me whatever you want, just so long as you don't call me late to supper...~
@9    = ~Darling. I think I would like that... love.~
@10   = ~Do we really have time for this?~
@11   = ~That was awful. That one was old when Myth Drannor was young. But it is good to see you joke, to see you smile. You should do it more often.~
@12   = ~Don't worry, it gets easier to say. All you need is practice, darling.~
@13   = ~(Tashia kisses you softly) So, there better not be any slacking off.~
@14   = ~I guess you kinda hand-picked bastard for yourself today, haven't you?~
@15   = ~(Upon waking, you find Tashia curled up next to you, still fighting to awaken.)~
@16   = ~Mmm, love... you...~
@17   = ~(Continue to lie by Tashia's side.)~
@18   = ~(Waken Tashia by nibbling on her ear.)~
@19   = ~(Start your day.)~
@20   = ~(Tashia wakes, and kisses you on the lips.)~
@21   = ~This is definitely one of the more pleasant ways to wake up. So what now?~
@22   = ~Would you mind watching the sunrise with me?~
@23   = ~This is pleasant, but we have to get going.~
@24   = ~Of course I will...~
@25   = ~You woke me up just to tell me to that it's time to get out of bed? Gee, thanks father.~
@26   = ~Oh, Arilistan...~
@27   = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm... I didn't mean, I mean, I'm...~
@28   = ~You thought I was Arilistan? Why am I not surprised. You still want him.~
@29   = ~Tashia, was that just a slip of the tongue, or do you still love him?~
@30   = ~<CHARNAME>, I wouldn't play with your feelings that way. I'm sorry this happened, but you are the only one for me. If I had any doubts as to your true feelings about me they were quelled when you resurrected me.~
@31   = ~It is still new to me, so forgive me if I stumble a bit...~
@32   = ~It's not like that at all. Damn it, I didn't mean to say that at all. But if you can't believe it, can't believe that it was just a slip of the tongue, maybe you aren't the man I thought you were.~
@33   = ~I didn't mean to hurt you. You know what he meant once. I'm sorry, part of that slipped through. But if you can't forgive me...~
@34   = ~Of course I forgive you. I just needed to be certain.~
@35   = ~I would never have done that to you Tashia. It's obvious to me that you aren't ready for another relationship.~
@36   = ~If you can't even forgive one mistake, then it's probably just as well we split up.~
@37   = ~(Tashia rises from her slumber. She smiles briefly before putting her things in order.)~
@38   = ~I'm getting tired of cold rations. Would you be up for another riddle contest? The winner would be the one to make dinner.~
@39   = ~Give the riddles a rest for the moment, Tashia, and stop complaining so much.~
@40   = ~That sounds like a good idea. Lay your riddle on me.~
@41   = ~Sure, but let's raise the stakes.~
@42   = ~Fine, have it your way. I do know I'm getting really tired of cutting the green from the meat.~
@43   = ~At the sound of me, men may dream
Or stamp their feet
At the sound of me, women may laugh
Or sometimes weep. What am I?~
@44   = ~Story.~
@45   = ~Victory.~
@46   = ~Music.~
@47   = ~A story. Well, that is close. After all, stories may bring several emotions to one's heart. Whether a well-written love story to wonderful tales of bravery to chortles of mirth, they certainly may inspire one to dream, but stomp one's feet? No, the answer you seek is music. Wrong, but a good try.~
@48   = ~Looks like you get to make dinner tonight.~
@49   = ~Tell you what, the next inn we come across you order whatever you want. Price is no object.~
@50   = ~(Attempt to make dinner with provisions you have.)~
@51   = ~Leery of eating your own cooking? Well, I will keep you to that promise then. I do suggest that you keep some extra coin in your purse.~
@52   = ~(Tashia takes a bite of your cooking.)~
@53   = ~Hey, this is really good. A girl could get accustomed to this...~
@54   = ~That is a rather good guess. I will be honest, I was thinking of 'Music' but I can see where victory may inspire dreams. Of course, some people do cry when achieving victory. So, I owe you a dinner.~
@55   = ~Wow. You're getting very good at this. It was indeed 'Music.' I shall get supper ready soon enough...~
@56   = ~(Tashia quickly prepares some simple fare.)~
@57   = ~How is it?~
@58   = ~This is actually pretty good.~
@59   = ~I doubt you have a future as a chef.~
@60   = ~Thanks, I'm glad you like it. I am not really a good cook. My step-mother would swear that I could burn water.~
@61   = ~It's not like cooking is one of my talents. Why do you think I wanted you to make dinner?~
@62   = ~Okay, and what stakes are you wanting to wager?~
@63   = ~On second thought, dinner sounds just fine. Bring on the riddle...~
@64   = ~How about a massage?~
@65   = ~Sex, and plenty of it.~
@66   = ~You know, just when I think I know you, you pull something like this. If you are in such great need of female companionship, go hire yourself a two-bit whore... preferably one with boils.~
@67   = ~Okay, it's a deal.~
@68   = ~When set loose
I fly away
Never so cursed
As when I go astray
What am I?~
@69   = ~Arrow.~
@70   = ~Tongue.~
@71   = ~Hope.~
@72   = ~An 'arrow'. Close, but the only way it would be a curse for going astray is if you happened to hit someone by accident. The answer was 'Tongue... ' Looks someone owes me a message.~
@73   = ~You're really getting much better at this, aren't you? Well, turn around. A bet is a bet, after all...~
@74   = ~Hope? That is an odd turn of thought. I guess I can see what you are talking about, though the answer I was looking for was 'Tongue' actually. I think that I will take a rain check on that back rub...~
@75   = ~Hmm, my mother warned me about men like you.~
@76   = ~Seriously, I think my foster parents would like you. Even though they might have a thing or two to say about your table manners.~
@77   = ~You can't think too highly of your parents. You left them, after all. I grow weary of your talk. Here is something to consider: silence is golden.~
@78   = ~What is wrong with my table manners? How was I supposed to know that you weren't supposed to blow your nose on the tablecloth?~
@79   = ~Tashia, in all the time we've been together, you really haven't talked about your foster parents before now. What were they like?~
@80   = ~How could you say that?~
@81   = ~I guess I was a fool to fall for you. If all you wanted was someone to sit there and look pretty, I'm sure you could have bought any number of whores with all the gold you've spent up to now. As it is, that's the only way you're going to get any female companionship from now on.~
@82   = ~Heh, thanks for making me laugh!~
@83   = ~It is a bit funny, though. When I am with you, my thoughts do occasionally turn to thoughts of family.~
@84   = ~Family? But I thought you wanted to travel, didn't you?~
@85   = ~Children? That is a big decision, and one we can't make lightly, especially with all that is happening.~
@86   = ~Family? Don't make me laugh. There is only one thing I want you for.~
@87   = ~Of course I want to travel, silly. We've just barely begun exploring the length and breadth of Faerun...~
@88   = ~After all, I left home to try and make my way alone, didn't I? I must admit, sometimes I get the urge of just finding a place to sit down, to rest, even if just a little.~
@89   = ~<CHARNAME>, you are utterly correct that children are a large step, and who knows where tomorrow will take us...~
@90   = ~But that doesn't mean a girl can't dream, can't she?~
@91   = ~And so the truth finally comes out. Damn you, <CHARNAME>! There are corpses that are less offensive than you.~
@92   = ~You better hope your hand doesn't seize up. That is the only companionship you will have from now on.~
@93   = ~My foster mother Abigail is a kind woman. Very industrious in fact. She has a predilection for cats. I mean, she has a whole shelf devoted to small cat figurines. She calls it her silly little hobby, but I remember one birthday when all of us managed to buy her a ceramic kitten. We accidentally dropped it, breaking its ear, but you would have thought we gave her the greatest treasure in the world. I don't recall any of us going to bed hungry. Even if we were grounded, she usually snuck something to us.~
@94   = ~Roald is our stepfather. Heh, he was fun to be around. Too much fun in fact. If it wasn't for Abigail, I think he would have let the farm waste away. He was always a dreamer. All the stories he told... I think he always wanted to be an adventurer, but he settled for being a farmer.~
@95   = ~Seems kind of boring when you hear it that way, doesn't it?~
@96   = ~Not at all. They took in several orphaned children, and made a family. Just like Gorion did with me; I miss him, even now...~
@97   = ~Not at all. I fell in love with the woman they raised, didn't I? When all this is done, would you like to see your parents again?~
@98   = ~I... am sorry for asking you about your parents. I'm sorry. That came out wrong. It's just it reminded me of Gorion and how I failed him.~
@99   = ~Why don't you tell me a bit more about Gorion. I get a sense for the man from the way you speak about him.~
@100  = ~He won't truly be gone if those who loved him continue to remember him.~
@101  = ~You... you mean that, don't you?~
@102  = ~I'm sorry. It's just... well, Arilistan never even asked me about my family, let alone my parents. And here you offer...~
@103  = ~Of course, we will go together. When all this is done.~
@104  = ~Don't apologize, I understand. However, you aren't alone in this. Remember, if you wish to talk, I am here.~
@105  = ~Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events.~
@106  = ~(Tashia's right hand creeps along the edge of your arm, while her left hand rests on the swell of your hip)~
@107  = ~Hmm... truth be known, I never expected this to happen, but until we get you cured, I suppose we'll have to make the best of a bad situation. Definitely will have to get you a bodice.~
@108  = ~Umm, I'm sorry, I mean...~
@109  = ~This excites you? I didn't take you for a deviant. If this is how you really are, then I see no reason for staying together.~
@110  = ~Tashia, this is awkward and your attentions are making it worse. I love you and everything, but I think we should wait until I get a cure.~
@111  = ~Tashia, there is nothing to apologize for. Shape really doesn't matter to me. I mean, who am I to cast stones when I can take on the Slayer?~
@112  = ~Maybe it hasn't occurred to you, you son of a bitch, but maybe, just maybe, what woman in her right mind would stay together with a man who's alternate form is that of the Slayer.~
@113  = ~Maybe that's different in your mind, but let me tell you <CHARNAME>, no woman in her right mind would fall for you unless she was already in love with you.~
@114  = ~I guess that old saying is true. There's no sin in loving men, only pain...~
@115  = ~I understand what you are saying, <CHARNAME>. Don't think anything further of it.~
@116  = ~I'll be honest. I didn't think that I would even have considered, well, you know. But, when I saw you that way, even if I was a bit uncertain about what to do, the one thing I knew for certain was that I loved you.~
@117  = ~But we will find a way to remove this curse, I promise. Then, you should be as good as new. For your sake, I hope we can do so before a month passes.~
@118  = ~Whatever form you take, whatever you look like, know that I do love you.~
@119  = ~Besides, it is said variety is the spice of life...~
@120  = ~Finally, land. I'll be so glad to get out of this salt air and into a warm tub.~
@121  = ~I am first mouth, then hand paired together for a message
That always means the same I am sent as the crow would go
But although some pretend to catch me,
My fate is to fly forever, never to arrive...~
@122  = ~(Run your finger through Tashia's hair) Could it be the wind?~
@123  = ~Kiss the flat of your palm, and then blow it toward Tashia.~
@124  = ~Perhaps it is a kiss, blown through the air?~
@125  = ~Could it be your golden voice?~
@126  = ~I don't really know.~
@127  = ~(Tashia leans back into your hand.)~
@128  = ~That is close, but not quite. The answer is a blown kiss.~
@129  = ~Um, let's get going.~
@130  = ~(Tashia turns, and pantomimes catching your kiss, and pressing it to her cheek.)~
@131  = ~(Suddenly, her eyes snap open and she turns her head aside, cheeks burning bright red.)~
@132  = ~Sorry, we still have to finish your quest, don't we?~
@133  = ~Correct. The answer is a blown kiss.~
@134  = ~ou are a cunning one, aren't you? I'm going to have to keep a close eye on you. Just in case you were curious, the answer is a blown kiss.~
@135  = ~Well, they say being too long at sea can addle one's wits.~
@136  = ~The answer is a blown kiss.~
@137  = ~Mine is the ungloved
pulsing fingertip
The shroud, the interface
of brittle leaves.~
@138  = ~Mine is the cruel purity
that snaps all iron,
Sends your warm breath
biting backwards.~
@139  = ~I am the splintered rainbow
locked in ice...~
@140  = ~Tashia? Are you alright?~
@141  = ~Is it frost?~
@142  = ~Is it death?~
@143  = ~Pull yourself together, woman!~
@144  = ~I'm alright, or I will be once we get out of here. Funny, I never thought I would miss the surface so greatly. Here, it's just cold, unfeeling stone beneath my feet. I feel... disjointed. Let's get out of here. Who knows what dwells in the shadows.~
@145  = ~That is correct. Frost is the answer. I guess I didn't believe the stories about how cold, how dark the Underdark is. Of course, I didn't believe I would ever come here.~
@146  = ~(Tashia leans in close to you, pressing slightly against you, then pulls away.)~
@147  = ~Umm... let's get going. We still have a lot to do.~
@148  = ~Well that is a suitably morbid answer. Given our surroundings, I guess I might say the same thing.~
@149  = ~Heh, the answer I was looking for was frost. I don't know about you, but I'm getting a bit cold. Let's go... I am already starting to miss the sun.~
@150  = ~Right. We have better things to do in the darkness... like snapping at those around us.~
@151  = ~(You get the feeling that you're being watched. From the corner of your eye, you see Tashia jerk her head away to look at something else when she realizes you notice her attention.)~
@152  = ~(Ignore what Tashia is doing)~
@153  = ~Is something wrong, Tashia?~
@154  = ~Oh I'm alright. I was just doing some remembering is all. You're close to her, aren't you? Imoen, I mean.~
@155  = ~Close? Don't make me laugh. She's been a constant pain in the ass ever since we left Candlekeep. I'm always rescuing her from danger. I should have let Irenicus keep her.~
@156  = ~Of course we are close. She was the sister I never had, while Gorion was my father. Sometimes I wonder how he could stand the two of us.~
@157  = ~Is that how you view her? Then what about me? Am I some kind of camp follower? Someone to sate your lust with? Someone who will take an arrow for you when we're ambushed?~
@158  = ~Of course. Irenicus needs to be stopped at all costs, and I am the only one able to do so. As such, my safety and needs come first.~
@159  = ~No, I'm just kidding. If that's all I thought of her, would I have risked life and limb to come rescue her?~
@160  = ~To hell with you! I am not going to be some kind of damn target for an arrogant, insufferable bastard like you. You Bhaalspawn are all the same.~
@161  = ~I didn't find that at all humorous. I like Imoen, and you really shouldn't say a thing like that.~
@162  = ~Heh, well I think all parents are like that. My foster parents were exactly the same way. Why, I remember the day we all climbed to the roof, pretending we could fly. I learned that day I wasn't an Avariel.~
@163  = ~Let's just say I think I have a good idea what an ass-kicking feels like.~
@164  = ~Heh. Once I picked wildflowers for someone for a gift...except it was poison ivy!~
@165  = ~Well, I never really had too many episodes like that growing up.~
@166  = ~Well, your heart was in the right place. And if you ever have an itch to scratch, I can... relieve you.~
@167  = ~That's a shame. It's those incidents that give such interesting stories to tell later on.~
@168  = ~It seems like the designers of this place were just as insane as the inmates. Gods, even with my eyes closed, my mind still wants to fill in all the parts that are missing, and remove the parts that are just wrong. This is going to be haunting my dreams tonight, that's for damn sure.~
@169  = ~Tashia, do you have another riddle for me? To get out of here will require us to keep our wits sharp.~
@170  = ~I swear, maybe I should have left you in Trademeet to drown your sorrows in ale. Why don't you get some backbone, shut up, and learn to put up with it.~
@171  = ~You're not the only one that feels out of place here. We'll get out of here as soon as possible, I promise.~
@172  = ~How dare you say that! You were the one who approached me! Hell, I told you to leave me alone.~
@173  = ~What does it matter. I will find my way out alone.~
@174  = ~Yes, let's get out of here. Everything is so confusing in this bedlam~
@175  = ~I think there is a flaw in your logic somewhere, but given the nature of this place, it does make some kind of twisted sense.~
@176  = ~Though giving pleasure to many
I am more than a passing fancy
A bagatelle. I am looked down upon
by my peers for my sense of fun."

Jealous introverts, they think me flippant
Silver-tongued I may be, but not irreverent
I am all show, all style.
Here is the key, come inside: I'll make you smile.~
@177  = ~The answer is you, isn't it? Your tongue, much like the rest of you, is a beauty to see and hear, and your joy of life lifts up my own spirits.~
@178  = ~Is the answer 'riddle'? Between the imagery as well as the innuendo, it couldn't be much else.~
@179  = ~I can't figure out the answer to the riddle. What is it?~
@180  = ~(Kiss her) The answer is you, isn't it?~
@181  = ~(Your compliments are enough to make any girl blush, but don't think your blandishments will give you victory. The answer to the riddle was 'riddle'.~
@182  = ~Heh, you figured out the answer. That's all that came to mind, sad to say. This stupid place is still affecting me, I guess. So, why not apply your great wit and find the exit out of here.~
@183  = ~Heh, maybe it wasn't one of my better riddles. The answer is exactly what the question itself is... the answer is riddle.~
@184  = ~A riddle that is its own answer if you will--the kind of test this place seems to rely on.~
@185  = ~What are you doing... no, I'm not the answer.~
@186  = ~The answer was... Um, never mind.~
@187  = ~Don't you sometimes wish that you had an extra pair of hands? Hmm, an extra pair of hands.~
@188  = ~Like what you see? You don't need to pussyfoot around an answer.~
@189  = ~Actually this gives me an idea, you know. You know how they say double the pleasure, double the fun.~
@190  = ~Isn't that kinda cheating? I mean using your simulacrum to help with your chores?~
@191  = ~Pussyfoot? I thought that was that rare birth defect that required one to wear open-toed sandals.~
@192  = ~Tashia, I don't even like the suggestion you are making. I was just looking to see if you needed any help, but I see that you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to your business.~
@193  = ~Oh, you don't need to be that way. You need to loosen up just a bit, but then again, that might be part of your charm.~
@194  = ~I guess it is cheating in a way. Then again, it does give us time for ourselves, while my simulacrum attends to other matters...~
@195  = ~Let me get this straight. You are talking about you and me... and me, together?~
@196  = ~Let me ask this question of you, then: if I can make a simulacrum of myself, then there is no reason I couldn't duplicate you. Tell me, how would you like being just one of a pair when we got... intimate?~
@197  = ~I guess fair is fair. Sure, if that's what you want, I'm willing to give it a whirl.~
@198  = ~I wouldn't like that idea one bit. It would be like someone pretending to be me.~
@199  = ~I will keep you to your promise then~
@200  = ~I guess the old saying is true... two heads are better than one..." ~
@201  = ~That was my feeling as well.~
@202  = ~Just be glad that you were caught staring at my... reflection, and not some other woman. I would really hate to have to hold your head in a bucket of ice cold water until you stopped kicking.~
@203  = ~<CHARNAME>, that was awful.~
@204  = ~Nice try side-stepping my question, but you won't get off the hook that easy. Now, honestly, would you like it if I did the exact same to you?~
@205  = ~Well, this may be spur of the moment, but I would be willing to try anything once.~
@206  = ~I guess you're right. Besides, I like the original best.~
@207  = ~You don't feel any different to me. Then again, it isn't everyday someone loses their soul.~
@208  = ~We will beat Irenicus, my love, and restore you, I promise. Maybe then, we can even find a way to get rid of the taint.~
@209  = ~Irenicus may have my soul, but you have my heart... guess which is more important to me.~
@210  = ~Do you honestly think we can remove my taint? Look what happened after Irenicus took it.~
@211  = ~Aren't you afraid of me? Sometimes it feels like I can barely control the Slayer. You would be safer away from me.~
@212  = ~Once I reclaim my birthright, nothing shall ever take it from me again.~
@213  = ~You shouldn't let such thoughts weigh you down. Maybe there is something we can do to let you forget such concerns, if only for a little while.~
@214  = ~If you were thinking of another riddle, maybe we can do that some other time. I appreciate your attempts to take my mind off the matter, but I'm afraid it won't work this time.~
@215  = ~But I will try not to speak of it again. You already have enough worries without me adding to them. Just remember, I will always be here for you.~
@216  = ~That's just like you, isn't it? You're still more worried about me than yourself.~
@217  = ~Is it so hard to believe that I feel the same way about you?~
@218  = ~I sometimes wonder. After all, don't you get scared of the Slayer?~
@219  = ~I would feel better about it if we could remove Bhaal's corruption entirely~
@220  = ~I never had many people in my life who felt that way about me.~
@221  = ~As much as I would like to stay here, we must continue onward.~
@222  = ~I'm sorry to hear that. However, I promise that I shall always remain by your side.~
@223  = ~You can't get rid of me that easily.~
@224  = ~Yes, let's continue, and bring this to an end.~
@225  = ~I...don't know if we can remove the taint. It should be possible. Irenicus did it after all. And yet, that wasn't the only thing he took. Somehow he also took your soul with it.~
@226  = ~If we get back what is mine, I won't allow another person to torture me in such a way.~
@227  = ~And if you could remove the taint, what would you do with it?~
@228  = ~And left me with the Slayer.~
@229  = ~This is idle speculation. Until we defeat Irenicus, we should continue.~
@230  = ~And I will do all in my power to keep you from being hurt again.~
@231  = ~Physical strength is measured by what we can carry; spiritual by what we can bear. I don't know if I could carry the burden you carry alone. But together? I will help you shoulder it.~
@232  = ~I don't know. I guess I haven't given that any thought.~
@233  = ~And who knows, if separated, it could easily bond to anything else. It could cause even more troubles than ever.~
@234  = ~All too true. If...no, not if, when we beat Irenicus, maybe it would be for the best to leave everything alone.~
@235  = ~Who knows what another attempt might do to you.~
@236  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, sometimes you scare me. Not when we are together like this, but when you lose control of yourself--like you did with the Slayer...~
@237  = ~I wouldn't knowingly hurt you, Tashia. Not now, not ever.~
@238  = ~Maybe you are attracted to that which endangers you.~
@239  = ~If you are so scared of me, we should split up until you are sure you want to be with me.~
@240  = ~Don't you think I would have removed Bhaal's touch if I could?~
@241  = ~I know you wouldn't, at least when you are yourself. It's the unknowns I fear, though.~
@242  = ~But I can't let my fear rule me. You are... you, not Arilistan.~
@243  = ~<CHARNAME>, that isn't even funny. I would ask you not to make another statement, even in jest, like that again.~
@244  = ~Maybe, you are right. It isn't fair to you if I fear being held in your arms.~
@245  = ~If I could rid myself of this 'birthright,' I would.~
@246  = ~Yes, it is a birthright, but one that can be as much of a curse, as a blessing.~
@247  = ~Yes, once I reclaim what is mine, nothing shall ever stand in my way.~
@248  = ~Our parents' leave their marks on us, don't they?~
@249  = ~But it is also up to us how much of our lives they touch.~
@250  = ~That...that is how Arilistan sounded just before he went bad.~
@251  = ~I...I can't go through that again. I'm sorry <CHARNAME>...I have to go.~
@252  = ~Hey, I remember that. You were giving it to Phlydia, weren't you? Heh, they both scratched all night. The monks took it as an opportunity to try all their herbal remedies on <CHARNAME>~
@253  = ~Of course, they could have taken him to a cleric, but they figured it would be a good lesson if they let the ivy take its course.~
@254  = ~Don't you believe him one instant. He could get in as much trouble as the rest of us, but <CHARNAME> was much better at shifting the blame. Sometimes his schemes didn't always go according to plan.~
@255  = ~I remember the time he went cow-tipping, and Nessie fell right on <CHARNAME>. He broke her fall and two of his ribs. He spent the next three months mucking out the barn. You could smell him from a mile away.~
@256  = ~I was expecting Lord <CHARNAME> to be a bit taller. You know, just like the heroes of legend. Seven feet tall, broad shouldered, thighs with which you can break tables, sloping forehead.~
@257  = ~Pardon my teasing, <CHARNAME>. Between the hunt for Irenicus and all your additional duties protecting Nalia's birthright, you seemed to be worn thin.~
@258  = ~That's right, there is always some damn quest or other that needs my attention. And all you can do is make jokes at my expense. Maybe, you could just be serious once.~
@259  = ~I apologize if I seemed distant. There have been to many things going on. Maybe you could share a riddle. I could use the distraction.~
@260  = ~Fair Maiden, I have slain fearsome dragons, and braved unspeakable terrors, but next to thine angelic presence, these triumphs pale. Dear Lady, wilst thou save my honor and grant thy heavenly companionship to me?~
@261  = ~I am sorry. Maybe no one else has told you this, but I'm proud of you. I'm sure that Gorion would have been proud of you too. Sometimes I forget how young you are.~
@262  = ~But you're killing yourself with this pace. I know you don't have much choice now, but you need to slow down, the sooner the better.~
@263  = ~You're right, this pace is going to kill me. I don't know when it will end, but there is nothing I would like to do more. I don't really want power. I just object to idiots having power over me.~
@264  = ~Well, thank you for stating the obvious. You know, one thing that I've found is the only person I can rely on, truly depend on, is myself.~
@265  = ~The one thing I've learned in my years: endure pain, find joy, and make your own meaning, because the world certainly isn't going to supply it.~
@266  = ~I guess that's why I'm so quick with a riddle, or a joke. Life is much too short to spend on continuous strife, worry, and sadness. But I find joy with you no matter what.~
@267  = ~I've heard this type of talk before... right before Arilistan kidnapped me, killed me. Even in death he couldn't let me go.~
@268  = ~I can't stand to be with someone who thinks strength is the end all and be all. I hope you are happy grasping for power, for it's going to be a long, lonely life.~
@269  = ~Very well. I am valued by men, fetched from afar, gleaned on the hill-slopes, gathered in groves, in dale and on down. All day through the air, wings bore me aloft, and brought me with cunning. Safe under roof, men steeped me in vats. Now I have power to pummel and bind, to cast to the earth, old man and young. Soon he shall find who reaches to seize me, pits force against force, that he's flat on the ground, stripped of his strength if he cease not his folly, loud in his speech, but of power despoiled to manage his mind, his hands or his feet. Now ask me my name, who can bind men on earth, and lay fools low in the light of day.~
@270  = ~Love, for just as you have claimed my heart, and laid me low, so can love do for any man.~
@271  = ~Is it mead or wine? For when drunk, it can lay the strongest man low?~
@272  = ~I don't know. What is it?~
@273  = ~It's not often that one who has said the wrong answer can still be so right. The answer was honey-mead, but your answer was sweeter than mine.~
@274  = ~Indeed, it is mead, actually, for it is made from honey, the wings that carry it being the flight of bees.~
@275  = ~The answer is honey-mead. That's okay, maybe you'll get it next time.~
@276  = ~I have faced powerful spirits, magical beasts, and evil men, but 'twas your eyes, m'lord, which finally smote me.~
@277  = ~I daresay I am up for another riddle. It has been a while since you sharpened your wit on me.~
@278  = ~My dear lady, thou art the loveliest creature that hath ever graced our world. Thy radiance far outshines that of the sun, moon, and all the stars in the night sky. Now grab your ankles.~
@279  = ~I was wondering how long you could keep such florid speech up. You've broken down my battlements, sirrah and laid siege to my heart...~
@280  = ~I guess sometimes I get a bit jealous of the... depth of your devotion to your deity.~
@281  = ~Jealous enough, and worried enough, that I sometimes wonder what will become of us.~
@282  = ~There is enough room for you and my god in my life. Have you ever felt such... a connection that made you feel important, no matter what else happens?~
@283  = ~If you have so little faith in me, if you have so much doubt in your heart, then I think it may be best that we go our ways.~
@284  = ~Tashia, just because one is a cleric doesn't mean they are discouraged from relationships.~
@285  = ~Well, pardon me for coming between you and your religion, you patronizing bastard. I don't know which is worse, the fact you just broke us up, or the unbelievable calm in which you split us apart.~
@286  = ~You know, it's people like you that cause me to doubt the necessity of priests. Claiming to be spiritual leaders, you make me wonder why the spirit world needs leaders.~
@287  = ~The priests do say that one's body is a temple. Are you conducting services today?~
@288  = ~Should I consider it a miracle you don't have a vow of chastity?~
@289  = ~Well, before you met me, before I left Arilistan, I would definitely have said yes.~
@290  = ~Oh, it's not like I am an atheist of some sort. Rather hard to not believe in the gods when they have a tendency of taking material form at their whim. Heh, and I imagine it's not the safest lifestyle, not unless you are pursuing a career in being a lightning rod.~
@291  = ~But now? I am uncertain. I mean, when I left with Arilistan, I was certain, absolutely certain that he changed, and...~
@292  = ~And you know what happened, but... there you were. I couldn't help but wonder, if Hanali Celanil and Sehanine Moonbow had a hand in you finding me, in loving me.~
@293  = ~Sometimes I think that it was Sehanine that led you to me. I mean, out of the entirety of Amn, you knew, you absolutely knew where to find me. Then, well, it all happened so fast, but I knew, I just knew I had to tell you how I felt. And to find out how you felt about me... I think it may have been a miracle.~
@294  = ~Then maybe both of us were given a miracle. It would be a shame to squander a gift from the gods, wouldn't it?~
@295  = ~Don't give it another thought. Here, let's change the topic.. It has been a while since you last told me a riddle. Besides, keeping in practice is a good way to be near you.~
@296  = ~It may be true that the gods had a hand in our coming together, but the choice is up to us mortals, and I chose you.~
@297  = ~That was the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. I...I am speechless...~
@298  = ~Here goes then:
I've got a beautiful, beautiful hall
All walled in red velvet
With all white armchairs made of bone
And in the middle a woman dances... ~
@299  = ~Is it your heart?~
@300  = ~Is it your mouth?~
@301  = ~(point at your crotch) Is that...the answer?~
@302  = ~My heart? Only if my chest was split open.~
@303  = ~You, sir, are correct. Looks like you won that round.~
@304  = ~No, silly it was 'mouth'. You sometimes have only one thing on your mind, don't you...~
@305  = ~You're getting pretty good at this, aren't you. You have your own branch of the thieves' guild. You're really becoming someone of notice Is this what you wish to do for the rest of your life? I must admit I find the idea a bit distasteful...being a thief that is.~
@306  = ~I mean what if you get caught? Or what if some kind of bitter underling decides they could lead better than you? What if this means that this is going to be the end of us?~
@307  = ~This is just a means to an end, nothing more or less. Whatever else happens, you will always come first for me Tashia.~
@308  = ~Why would you even think that? Who will be there to inspire me to greater and greater deeds? Who would I splurge my ill-gotten gains on if not you?~
@309  = ~I wouldn't worry about that right now. We should just focus on getting stronger. We're going to need it facing Irenicus. Compared to him, Mae'Var was nothing.~
@310  = ~That is very heartening to hear. That this isn't going to be a permanent situation I mean. I guess I'm still a bit afraid of losing you; of you turning on me.~
@311  = ~That was the sweetest thing someone has said to me in a long time...~
@312  = ~Why sir, I do believe you are trying to seduce me. However, I am spoken for.~
@313  = ~A man honest and true, one who admired me from afar, though I knew it not, came to me in my darkest hour...~
@314  = ~And I love him dearly for it.~
@315  = ~You're looking forward to this, aren't you? I mean, the challenge of running the guildhouse. No, don't deny it or confirm it, I can see it in your eyes, but even more than that is the anticipation of the conflicts to come?~
@316  = ~I know we can't live in the past, but I don't want to just live for today without any thought for tomorrow. Please, don't lose yourself as you confront your enemies.~
@317  = ~Who would have thought, after all that's happened in my life, the loss of my birth parents, the emergence of my powers, a betrayal, that I could still find happiness. With you, though, I have everything I could want.~
@318  = ~Except maybe for washboard abs...~
@319  = ~And what do you want, my love?~
@320  = ~Why, whatever you want most in the world my love. Well, except maybe for washboard abs. I don't relish doing my laundry on your stomach.~
@321  = ~Tashia, you always had everything you could ever want. If power is an illusion, isn't weakness necessarily one as well?~
@322  = ~Nothing really, other than enjoy my time with you. Perchance you may have a riddle that might be suitable for the mood?~
@323  = ~I have a few ideas about that. Why, between the two of us, there is nobody who could stand in our way.~
@324  = ~What I want requires... privacy.~
@325  = ~And you better not fall asleep on me...~
@326  = ~Ooh, philosophy. It's the first time anyone has tried that on me.~
@327  = ~I know you are trying to make me feel better, but you should be careful what you say. After all language can be a tool for concealing the truth, and you wouldn't want me to think you were disingenuous.~
@328  = ~Damn you to the lowest levels of the Abyss, you bastard!~
@329  = ~You're no different than Arilistan. All you can think of is your precious 'domination.' I won't be part of that at all!~
@330  = ~Often I swallow what thrusts against me,
when I, encircled by rings, must push
hard against the hard thing, the hole from behind—
shove forward what protects
the treasure of my lord in the middle of the night....~
@331  = ~Is it what I think it is? The greatest treasure in all of Amn?~
@332  = ~Naughty girl. The first answer to come to mind isn't always the one you want. The answer is keyhole.~
@333  = ~And just what were you thinking? The answer was keyhole, just in case you are asked again.~
@334  = ~That is entirely correct. So does my lord possess the... key to my keyhole?~
@335  = ~So, what is my knight in shining armor up to? You've been a bit quiet since you joined the Chapter-House of the Order.~
@336  = ~I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know where we are headed. I gave my loyalty to the Order, and it must come first, even before you. I don't know if it will work out between us.~
@337  = ~Oh I wasn't really thinking of anything in particular, just that I wouldn't mind getting out of this armor, and get a nice, hot bath. I certainly could use the company.~
@338  = ~I wasn't thinking of anything that serious at all. I was just remembering a joke Imoen once told me. I have to admit, it isn't exactly fit for polite conversation.~
@339  = ~If you are going to give someone a dismissal, you really should work on your approach. If you want to walk away from me, from us, that is up to you. As for me, I'm willing to make this work.~
@340  = ~I'm sorry, Tashia. Of course I want us to stay together.~
@341  = ~I think it would be best for the both of us if we separated.~
@342  = ~Then don't give it a second thought. Whatever happens, happens. That will be tomorrow, but we still have today.~
@343  = ~Your concern does you credit, but you know... unnecessary worrying can cause wrinkles.~
@344  = ~I guess I should have seen this coming.~
@345  = ~First Arilistan, now you.~
@346  = ~Why sir, I do believe that was a formal invitation, was it not?~
@347  = ~You know, though, you don't really smell that bad. There once was a mama mole, a papa mole, and a baby mole who all lived in a little hole. One day the papa mole sticks his head out of the hole, sniffs the air and says, 'Yum! I smell honey!' The mama mole sticks her head out of the hole, sniffs the air and says, 'Yum! I smell strawberry jam!' The baby mole tries to stick his head out of the hole to sniff the air, but can't because the bigger moles are in the way. So he says, 'Geez, all I can smell is molasses.~
@348  = ~Yes, um, that was very...amusing.~
@349  = ~I see your wit is much like a temple. Are you conducting services today?~
@350  = ~Forget about it. It wasn't that amusing, I guess.~
@351  = ~I shall stick to riddles from now on.~
@352  = ~You are learning, dear sir, you are learning.~
@353  = ~But when you are ready, I can help with all the hard to reach spots...~
@354  = ~And since when has that ever really stopped me? Now, you realize that since you've told me all of this, you have to tell the joke.~
@355  = ~Um, on second thought, I guess it really isn't appropriate. I'm sorry I even mentioned it after all.~
@356  = ~There once was a king who was getting sort of bored after dinner one night. He decided to hold a contest of who at the court had the mightiest 'weapon.'...~
@357  = ~Oh, fine, I will let you weasel out of this today.~
@358  = ~And they usually talk about women changing their minds, don't they?~
@359  = ~Heh, I didn't think you had it in you. I'm glad you aren't such a stick in the mud as many other paladins are.~
@360  = ~I think that Imoen was a good influence on you.~
@361  = ~This reminds me of home. Well, it was a lot colder, a lot whiter. Heh, okay, maybe it doesn't look like home, but it does remind me of home.~
@362  = ~Heh, sorry to distract you. So, what are you doing?~
@363  = ~I was thinking that some fresh meat would be welcome, so I might go hunting by myself.~
@364  = ~Well, I was thinking my lady and I could spend some time together.~
@365  = ~I am kind of at lose ends at the moment. If you would like to try one of your riddles again, let's see if I have improved.~
@366  = ~I didn't really have anything in mind. I might go take a leak. Why, is there something you need?~
@367  = ~Let me give you this parting thought before you go hunting.~
@368  = ~This happened to a couple I knew back in Targos. There was a man who worked hard all week, but instead of going home, he liked to stay out the entire weekend hunting. When he finally did get home 2 or 3 days later, he was confronted by his very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade about his actions.~
@369  = ~Finally, his wife stopped the nagging and asked him, 'How would you likeit if you didn't see me for two or three days?' ~
@370  = ~To which he replied, 'That would be fine with me.' The first day went by and he didn't see his wife. The next two days came and went with the same results. As the fourth day arrived, the swelling went down just enough where he could see his wife a little out of the corner of his left eye.~
@371  = ~I wish you good hunting...~
@372  = ~And just what did you have in mind, my lord?~
@373  = ~Well, I could go for one of your riddles about now.~
@374  = ~I don't know. Maybe see what adornments I can find for you, such as this rose.~
@375  = ~(Press your lips urgently to meet Tashia's, saving dialogue for later.)~
@376  = ~This is beautiful...~
@377  = ~(Lean in and kiss Tashia.)~
@378  = ~Well, I guess am just a 'blooming' idiot for you.~
@379  = ~Tashia, I think maybe this has gone too far, too fast. I don't mean to hurt you, but you deserve better than this.~
@380  = ~Do you carrot all for me? My heart beets for you, with your turnip nose and your radish face, you are a peach. If we cantaloupe, lettuce marry. Weed make a swell pear.~
@381  = ~Gods above, now you have me doing it too.~
@382  = ~You bastard, how could you do this to me?!~
@383  = ~Do you take some perverse glee out of playing with my emotions, you son-of-a-bitch?~
@384  = ~Come, my love. Let's claim this time as our own...~
@385  = ~In former days my father and mother, abandoned me dead, lacking breath or life or being. Then one began, a kinswoman kind, to care for and love me; covered me with her clothing, wrapped me in her raiment, with the same affection she felt for her own; until by the law of my life's shaping, under alien bosom I quickened with breath. My foster mother fed me thereafter, until I grew sturdy and strengthened for flight. Then of her dear ones, of daughters and sons, she had the fewer for what she did.~
@386  = ~It's a cuckoo, isn't it?~
@387  = ~It's you, isn't it?~
@388  = ~Um, I'll have to answer this later. I, uh... have a call of nature.~
@389  = ~I should have guessed that you would figure out such an easy riddle. You are right, it is a cuckoo, the bird whose mother lays her egg in another's nest, and then when the egg hatches, the baby cuckoo pushes its 'siblings' from the nest until it alone is left. I guess I shall have to start using some of the less forest-related riddles, shouldn't I?~
@390  = ~No, it wasn't me. The answer is cuckoo.~
@391  = ~But I love the sentiment, silly...~
@392  = ~Eww. Thank you for sharing that with me.~
@393  = ~I'll leave you along while you give your valuable... contribution to Mother Nature in peace.~
@394  = ~Heh, you really have turned the playhouse around, haven't you? Maybe I'm feeling just a bit jealous of the playhouse, though, for now that you have it, what does that mean between you and me? I mean, I've heard of obsessed artists after all.~
@395  = ~Well, I know a way we can stay together. The acting is getting stale, so I'm thinking of bringing in some dancers. You could be the headliner, if you wish.~
@396  = ~I would love you having a hand in the playhouse. What would you say to hosting a riddle contest in between acting gigs?~
@397  = ~I don't really know what the future will hold. Yes, I have the playhouse now, but we will have to find out what tomorrow holds.~
@398  = ~What... what are you talking about? I don't smell any alcohol on your breath.~
@399  = ~So, what gave you this... brilliant brainstorm anyway?~
@400  = ~I'm sorry. I wasn't being serious, I was just trying to lighten the mood up. One thing I wasn't kidding about was how beautiful you are.~
@401  = ~Well, it is bound to make more money. And look at it this way, we will be working side by side.~
@402  = ~Okay, you got me... hah-hah.~
@403  = ~But if you want me to dance for you, you are going to have to dance for me, but only for an audience of one. I don't like to share.~
@404  = ~You would make me a stripper? Why not just make me your whore while your at it?~
@405  = ~I will have none of it. I wish I could say this surprises me, but after Arilistan, and now you, I should be used to it.~
@406  = ~That is a sweet thought. And I must admit that it would be nice change of pace from risking our lives all the time.~
@407  = ~I'm told a certain something grows in its pouch, swells and stands up, lifts its covering. A proud bride grasped that boneless wonder, the daughter of a king covered that swollen thing with clothing.~
@408  = ~Is it bread dough?~
@409  = ~Is it something naughty?~
@410  = ~Damn. I thought for sure that you would miss that one. Heh, but it is a good thing you have such a clear head for riddles.~
@411  = ~I can see where your mind is at, but the answer was bread dough.~
@412  = ~Who knows, maybe later we see if we can get a rise out of something else.~
@413  = ~Too true. The future isn't writ in stone.~
@414  = ~But I do take heart that you at least see 'we' making that decision together.~
@415  = ~It is kind of liberating being out here, away from the cities, where no one is looking at you.~
@416  = ~Well, I guess you would know better than I would. After all, you were the one to become a druid, and a Great Druid at that. It kind of makes me wonder what you want to do now.~
@417  = ~Nothing right now. I'm just thinking, if you want to know the truth.~
@418  = ~I might do some grubbing you know. Collect herbs and such. No reason to waste magic on something that a simple poultice or potion would do.~
@419  = ~I didn't really have anything planned. We have some time to kill, so if you want to share a riddle, go ahead.~
@420  = ~Nothing really important. However if it's not too much, can we proceed along in silence?~
@421  = ~Oh? And just what were you thinking about?~
@422  = ~Faldorn mostly. No matter what else transpired, she was a druid much like I am. I brought about her defeat, but what if in the long run she was right?~
@423  = ~Oh, deep thoughts. You know the type, like if a man yells in the woods and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?~
@424  = ~Damn, now you made me forget what I was thinking about. Then again, I don't regret having you on my mind.~
@425  = ~For what it is worth, I don't think that you will be like Faldorn. I don't really have anything else to say. You will come up with an answer one way or another.~
@426  = ~Well, I guess that will teach me to ask a serious question of you. But seriously, what are you up to?~
@427  = ~Nothing really, but I have time for a riddle.~
@428  = ~Just gathering some herbs. I have a recipe you may care to try.~
@429  = ~Actually, if you don't mind too much, I would just like some time alone. Its been a while since I... communed with Nature.~
@430  = ~Well, at least you didn't say you were going to plough my field. Just what are you able to make with those plants?~
@431  = ~(Create a potion that will treat Tashia's fatigue, and give it to Tashia.)~
@432  = ~(Create a potion that is an aphrodisiac, and give it to Tashia.)~
@433  = ~Tashia, please, leave me alone. I am in the middle of something important and can't be disturbed.~
@434  = ~My aches, pains... they're fading. That's an excellent recipe, but you really should figure out something to discharge that awful taste. Such as ground up toad.~
@435  = ~Say, this is good, really good. Hmm, everything feels funny. It...it feels like there is a buzzing on my insides. My loins, they feel...~
@436  = ~You... you bastard! You son of a bitch! You tried to drug me! Why? Why?!?~
@437  = ~I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall--I stand up in bed--and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet... what am I?~
@438  = ~Are you a thorny rose?~
@439  = ~Are you perchance an onion, one that makes a lady cry?~
@440  = ~(Lower your hand to just below your waist) Is this the answer?~
@441  = ~Hmm, I really need to find some hard ones, or else you remembered this one from before, the thorn of the rose piercing the fingers of the young maiden, bringing tears to her eyes.~
@442  = ~Since when is an onion red? I guess even master druids can be wrong at times. The answer is a thorny rose.~
@443  = ~Heh, why do they always go for the vulgar intimation? No, that is not the answer.~
@444  = ~I can understand that. Sometimes it's just nice to having nothing to do, having nothing on your mind. I will leave you to your... deep thoughts.~
@445  = ~Never would I have imagined myself falling in love with a monk. After all, don’t most stories have monks living off somewhere in the desert, contemplating their navel? Then again, most childhood crushes tend to be of the valiant knight variety.~
@446  = ~But there are certain other advantages too. Your flexibility, for one.~
@447  = ~Don’t be so surprised about my love. There are some schools that teach improvement in isolation, the way to know oneself is remove all distractions. Then there are other schools which eschew such seclusion.~
@448  = ~There are many schools, love. Not all of us are ascetics, eschewing the simplest of human contact. Enlightenment is the destination, but the journey is a whole lifetime. Of course, it helps to travel light.~
@449  = ~Heh, there are many things I love about you as well. Some of your riddles are as good as the koans I contemplate. Would you care to share one with me at this moment?~
@450  = ~Actually, that is something we need to discuss. I am finding our... relationship to be a distraction. I think it would be best if we were to separate.~
@451  = ~(laughs) I think it is obvious which school you follow. Are... are you certain, though?~
@452  = ~Everything happened so fast around us, I don’t want you to regret being with me.~
@453  = ~There is nothing to regret. I am no callow youth, no ignorant child to love you. Besides, there is still much for me to learn about you.~
@454  = ~Some believe we are born with a half soul, and the reason for our life is to find our other half. I think my own search is complete.~
@455  = ~Maybe you’re right. This is going too fast, and we need to slow things down.~
@456  = ~And there is much for me to learn from you.~
@457  = ~You are by far the best kisser I’ve known. Must be all those breathing exercises you do.~
@458  = ~A bit corny, but I still love you for it.~
@459  = ~Still, any girl would melt at such words. What could be more romantic than knowing that there is someone special, just waiting for you to appear.~
@460  = ~Travel light? Heh. Is that a more subtle way of saying we shouldn’t hold onto our regrets, our failures?~
@461  = ~Still, I appreciate being with you. It makes the journey that much more enjoyable, don’t you think? Even if you sometimes drive me crazy with your platitudes.~
@462  = ~There are some who gain wisdom in solitude. There are others who cultivate enlightenment in the company of others.~
@463  = ~If you think I’m bad with my sayings, you should see some of old the masters. However, I find your riddles as preoccupying. Still, I love to test myself against them.~
@464  = ~The only burden we carry is what we assume for ourselves. However, the time grows short. I think we should be on our way.~
@465  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>, let’s go. Sometimes, though, I don’t think it is the burden I mind so much, as the hope that I might have a stronger back.~
@466  = ~I...I don’t understand. You end our relationship just because you say it is a distraction? I sure as hell don’t know where that came from, but I don’t really care to find out. Fine, have it your way, we’re finished.~
@467  = ~Spirituality: the last refuge of a failed life. Just another way of distracting yourself from what you are.~
@468  = ~A lovely woman, a lady, safeguarded me to the utmost; at times she plied me with her fingers, and other times gave me to her lord and loyal master. Then he poked his head inside me, pushed it up until it fitted tightly. I, adorned, was bound to be filled with something rough if the loyal lord could keep it up. Guess what I mean?~
@469  = ~(Lay a hand on Tashia’s thigh) I can only think of one answer for it, but maybe it isn’t so simple.~
@470  = ~Is it a helmet? Or a kirtle?~
@471  = ~I really have no idea what it is.~
@472  = ~Naughty, naughty. Though it is said a monk’s body and mind are as one. I certainly can’t argue such... answer.~
@473  = ~Heh, I guess that you will be teaching me a thing or two about riddlecraft before too much longer.~
@474  = ~The answer was helmet, although I've heard kirtle as an alternate answer.~
@475  = ~Mmm, you are my rock, you know. In this world of change, in this time of chaos, you are my sole bastion.~
@476  = ~Given any thought to your... our future? Will you always be there for me?~
@477  = ~Of course I will always be there for you. But I also like the challenges of life It helps keep me strong. Being strong means both mentally and physically. Perhaps you would like to help me flex my mind by telling me one of your riddles.~
@478  = ~Oh, I don't know what my future holds, other than that you are the most important part of it. It's funny, I always distrusted magic. I felt caged in Candlekeep. Imagine my surprise when I found that the most important person in my life is also the most magical.~
@479  = ~You will always have a place by my side, but you have to know that I doubt I will ever live a life of ease. Would you choose to live that way for the rest of your life? It is one only you can make.~
@480  = ~Tashia, you're smothering me. Have you thought that maybe, just maybe, I would not have had to rescue you if you had been stronger? If you wish to remain by my side, you must learn to be strong as well.~
@481  = ~I don't know that I would go so far as to assume that all of life is a test, but you are right that sometimes it is a struggle. How is that old saying go? That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.~
@482  = ~Okay, here is a riddle I've been saving up especially for you:
I'm strong and pointed. Shuddering, I die,
a violent release. For my reputable master
I'll plunge below the plimsoll line,
well and truly engineer an opening.
A desperate man stands behind me and develops me
himself; he carries a cloth. Sometimes one helps
me out of a wet hot spot
sometimes he gets me into a fix and forces me.
Say what I am called.~
@483  = ~(Gesture near your groin.) The answer can't be what I am thinking it is, can it?~
@484  = ~The answer is a poker or a brand.~
@485  = ~You have me beat Tashia. What is the answer?~
@486  = ~Hmm, guess you were reading my mind after all. That is one thing I appreciate about you, you know. How straightforward you are.~
@487  = ~I find it refreshing. And in you, quite becoming.~
@488  = ~Damn, I didn't think you would get a correct answer.~
@489  = ~Especially considering that I wasn't even thinking of that as an answer...~
@490  = ~Well, there were plenty of answers.~
@491  = ~Many would say a poker or firebrand would be an answer. Although I was thinking of something else more... rigid.~
@492  = ~That is sweet of you to say so, and I can understand your reluctance of magic.~
@493  = ~I can no more rid myself of it, than you can rid yourself of the taint. It is part of who we are, something we both must accept.~
@494  = ~Oh, testing my metal? Or is that mettle?~
@495  = ~Such as having a will of iron? Or nerves of steel? Possibly a heart of gold?~
@496  = ~Just remember, heat... shapes metal.~
@497  = ~And just what do you mean by that? If you truly think that I'm so weak, then why the hell would you rescue me?~
@498  = ~Well, here is something for you to consider, he of the stuffed loincloth. It doesn't matter how strong you are, death claims all: weak and strong, young and old.~
@499  = ~Hmm. You feel real enough to me.~
@500  = ~Heh. Sorry, I was just thinking of all that you've done. You have managed to defeat a great evil, gained said evil's base of operations, and even managed to make peace with the Cowled Wizards, or some members of it. If I didn't know better, I would have thought you were a tall tale.~
@501  = ~So what are you going to do about that grey big iron ball? I wonder if Lavok had some kind of physical issues he was trying to compensate for.~
@502  = ~I might go into business for myself. I just need to find an angle. Ribald Barterman already has cornered most of the market.~
@503  = ~I may continue where Lavok faltered. I think I know where he went wrong. Imagine, eternal life...with your help of course.~
@504  = ~I don't really know. It is just gathering dust there. Maybe I should just rent it out. True, it is not in a prime location, but the place is practically fireproof.~
@505  = ~And what do you mean by unique?~
@506  = ~Beauty aids! Magical cosmetics! Just think what we could do with a few Growth spells!~
@507  = ~On second thought, maybe it was just a stupid idea. Too many mages become solitary nuts living in a tower.~
@508  = ~A magic joke shop. The magic is such even an apprentice could cast, but it would be a hit with the kids.~
@509  = ~You better not be intimating that I could stand with some... expansion. After all, some might speak of your own shortcomings.~
@510  = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the mood. Whatever you decide, I'm just happy being with you.~
@511  = ~That is an... interesting idea. Why the mind boggles just at what you could accomplish with a Stinking Cloud spell.~
@512  = ~It is nice to see you have a sense of humor... unlike Arilistan.~
@513  = ~How can you even entertain such thoughts?~
@514  = ~Maybe it's the taint within you talking, maybe it's not, but to follow where Lavok failed... how you could consider something so abhorrent?~
@515  = ~That is a thought. If you decide to only rent to halflings and gnomes, then you could certainly get more money out of the structure than if you rented to humans. You know, be known as a low-rent place.~
@516  = ~Sorry, I know that was a bit of a stretch.~
@517  = ~Ugh... will you take a look at this? Stand up to the wind and rain, my ass. Guaranteed to last for years.~
@518  = ~One of these days, they will invent a material that stands up to the rigors of travel.~
@519  = ~And I'm not going to don just a leather bustier and thong. Maybe some of these wannabe sword-bunnies like to wear it all day long, but you know what sweaty leather smells like? And I just don't know what goes on in their mind as to how that will protect them. Maybe they figure they can distract the men by flashing their breasts.~
@520  = ~Here, this should be enough to buy you a whole new wardrobe. I've got a few things to round up myself, but I will meet you back at the inn.~
@521  = ~I don't know, I can think of a few things we could do instead of shopping. I don't know, I can think of a few things we could do instead of shopping.~
@522  = ~Just what is it with women and clothing? I guess I should be glad that you don't break down at the sight of spiders, and start crying, but damn...~
@523  = ~Hmm... I didn't even think that things were getting that thread-bare, but now that you mentioned, you are right. Tell you what, let's go get some new clothes. My treat.~
@524  = ~You know, I do have enough money of my own.~
@525  = ~Thanks for the consideration, though. I'll meet you back at the inn then...~
@526  = ~Is that all you can think of?~
@527  = ~Tell you what, when we get alone, then we shall see...~
@528  = ~And sometimes I have to wonder about you guys. Tell me, is it some kind of machismo that tells you guys to open your mouth and stick your foot all the way in? Maybe it's satisfactory for you to run around in a plain loincloth, letting your privates be exposed to the elements. Tell you what, the next time you get cold, I'll let you warm yourself up. Maybe when your ass freezes off, you'll learn to curb your tongue...~
@529  = ~Are you really sure about that? I mean, I normally don't care to go shopping myself. Okay, let's go...~
@530  = ~Well, I'm done with my shopping... what is that you have there?~
@531  = ~(Give Tashia the pelt.)~
@532  = ~Who is this for?~
@533  = ~This is yours, of course.~
@534  = ~Thank you.~
@535  = ~Well, that's that. I managed to bargain everything down to about 10 gold pieces.~
@536  = ~Hmm, there is a difference in it, isn't there?~
@537  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@538  = ~(Tashia wanders off with the shopkeeper, choosing new garments as she goes.)~
@539  = ~The first knight stood up and proclaimed that he had the mightiest weapon. He pulled down his pants and tied a 5-pound weight around it. The weapon then rose. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, and the band played appropriate music. Another knight stood up and yelled that he had the mightiest weapon.~
@540  = ~He dropped his pants and tied a 10-pound weight to himself. The weapon also rose. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, and the band played appropriate music. After several more knights tried to prove their superiority...the King finally spoke out. 'I have the mightiest weapon of them all!'~
@541  = ~He dropped his pants and tied, not a 10-pound, not a 20-pound, not even a 30-pound, but a 40-pound weight to himself. The weapon did rise. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, the band played and the crowd screamed 'God Save the Queen!~
@542  = ~Looks like your... friend is going to be a while. The name is Aimilíona Goldmantle, I'm partners with yon shopkeeper. He attends to the clothing, while the armor is my purview.~
@543  = ~You have the look of adventurers about you, so I know your kind normally doesn't go in for such fripperies as these. However, if you are of an interest, I may have something that might strike your fancy.~
@544  = ~This came from a winter wolf. (She lifts an edge of the pelt, beckoning you to touch it. As your hand explores the fur, you find that the pelt is among the softest materials you've ever touched.)~
@545  = ~Handworked... took about a month to soften. However, care was also taken to retain its resistance to the chill... definitely waterproof. Normally it would go for... 15,000 gold pieces... but it would stay here until the winter, and I would prefer to have the free space. I can let it go for as cheap as 12,000 gold pieces.~
@546  = ~Hmm. It is an excellent cape, I will grant you, but that is a large amount of funds to come up with on a moment's notice, and who knows when I will be back this way. Tell you what, I will give you 10,000 gold pieces.~
@547  = ~Well, that is a lot of money, but Tashia is worth every gold piece. Aimilíona, you have a deal.~
@548  = ~I'm sorry, friend, but that is much too high. I'm afraid I'm unable to pay for that amount now.~
@549  = ~I'm sorry, but I can't go any lower than my initial offer. Take it or leave it...~
@550  = ~All right then, I'll take it.~
@551  = ~Sorry, I can't afford that.~
@552  = ~It's good doing business with you, sir. I hope you enjoy the cloak.~
@553  = ~By the way, if in the future you would like additional adornment, I am quite capable of enhancing the original. It didn't make sense to do so if no one was going to purchase it, but I am more than willing to work further on it... just bring me the proper materials, and for a price, it will be better than new.~
@554  = ~Well, if you change your mind, it will be here for a bit longer, but I can make no guarantee that it will be here.~
@555  = ~Welcome back, good sir! So, have you changed your mind about the pelt? Still a steal at the reasonable price of 12,000 gold pieces.~
@556  = ~Not today. I'm just passing through.~
@557  = ~That's why I'm here. Here's your money.~
@558  = ~12,000 gold is still too high for a scrap of skin.~
@559  = ~I'm sorry, but I can't go any lower than my initial offer. Take it or leave it.~
@560  = ~It's good doing business with you, sir. I hope you enjoy the cloak. Also, I would be remiss in mentioning that if you are so inclined, we can include additional fripperies which improve on the base cape. Available for a modest fee, of course.~
@561  = ~Very well, I shall put it back. If you return this way, it may still be here. However, I can guarantee that as the colder months come closer, it will be gone.~
@562  = ~Welcome back, good sir! I trust there is nothing wrong with your purchase? Maybe it slipped my mind at the time, but all sales are final.~
@563  = ~I didn't mean to come back here.~
@564  = ~You mentioned something about improving the cloak?~
@565  = ~Ah, you just took a wrong turn. It happens to the best of us. Why, when the road of life seems to be just one off-beaten path by another, sometimes it takes something special to set it straight. Let me tell you about a book that changed my life, my friend...~
@566  = ~Indeed I did. Truth be known, what you possess is actually the lower end, more affordable winter cloak. Some of our more upper-scale clientele, however, demand accoutrement more befitting of their status. You will find that after our treatment of the fur, it offers the same protection as light armor, but is still as soft and pliable to the touch. Not only that, but the wearer of such a garment finds the cloak has captured the very touch of winter in its folds--which can be released at a later point.~
@567  = ~Of course, the craftsmanship involved in creating such an item is such that we can only make it when the proper buyer gives proper payment. However, for the low price of 30,000 gold, you can own the Winter Cloak. I must warn you, though, due to the labor and materials involved, we can't haggle on the price.~
@568  = ~No price is too high. I will get it.~
@569  = ~30,000 gold? That's too rich for my blood.~
@570  = ~Are you sure there is no way to lower the price?~
@571  = ~Very good, sir. That is an attitude I can approve of. Here is your cloak. If by chance you find the enchantments failing, you can bring it back within thirty days for a refund.~
@572  = ~I'm sorry to hear you think the price is too high. I bid you good day. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.~
@573  = ~I apologize sir, but as mentioned, the cost can't be haggled down. The interplay of spells, as well as the raw cost of materials, and not to mention our resident enchanter's fees put it out of the range of all but the wealthiest of clients.~
@574  = ~However, you also appear to be of an adventuring sort, so there just may be a way to defray the cost. We can't ignore our enchanter's costs, but if you could acquire the raw materials, you would find the costs definitely lessened... say, around the neighborhood of 7,500 gold pieces.~
@575  = ~See, to guarantee the required amount of defense, the most basic amulet of protection is used in the making of the cloak. Additionally, the cloak gains its cone of cold capabilities through the sacrifice of a wand of frost. To channel all the magical energies properly, we use a perfectly cut diamond.~
@576  = ~I will have to return when I find all you're looking for.~
@577  = ~What do you know, I already have them.~
@578  = ~I wish you luck on your quest then. Remember, you can always pay the extra amount if your searching doesn't yield the desired items.~
@579  = ~Very, very good. I will just take those items from you, and we shall see about getting your enhanced cape back to you.~
@580  = ~Another return visit? I must say I'm flattered, but I hope you realize that I'm already spoken for. Or are you back here on business?~
@581  = ~I didn't mean to come here.~
@582  = ~I have the money to buy the improvement of the cloak.~
@583  = ~Well, I got everything you wanted.~
@584  = ~Good day, sir. I hope you are enjoying your purchase.~
@585  = ~It was an honor to be outbid by m'lady. But I won't deny I hope it will be some time before you come this way again. My family needs to eat, after all...~
@586  = ~You have taken too much already! You will return both Imoen's soul and Tashia!~
@587  = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Tashia and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@588  = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Tashia alone. She is very important to me.~
@589  = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment. The theft of Tashia will not save you.~
@590  = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure her fate will still serve as an example.~
@591  = ~Here she is, though I doubt your fumbling could inspire the loyalty I take with a bite and a gaze. Not even fully turned, and they are mine to command. For all your words, all your protests, breaking your will was mere child's play, wasn't it my dear?~
@592  = ~I really must commend you, <CHARNAME>. She took to undeath quite well, almost necrophilic really. Then again, you're the heir to the Lord of Murder, and would find death quite attractive, in your females, wouldn't you? But don't worry, you shall join your beloved soon enough.~
@593  = ~Y...yes mistress, it was.~
@594  = ~Consider the needs of young Tashia here. It is so hard on your couples when you are separated.~
@595  = ~I wasn't thinking of you losing him. This is a lesson, <CHARNAME>. Follow me and you will lose more than you could imagine. Starting now!~
@596  = ~I have already lost one close to me, I refuse to lose another! When I am done with you, I shall scatter your ashes to the winds!~
@597  = ~Is...is that you <CHARNAME>? I...I was drowning in a wave of blood. I tried to scream, but the blood just flowed down my throat. I...I don't remember much except for the darkness that followed.~
@598  = ~I...I died again, didn't I? Twice...twice dead. And you saved me again. If...if I ever had any doubts about how you feel about me, they have been laid to rest.~
@599  = ~Tashia, you won't get rid of me that easily.~
@600  = ~Let's try to make sure third time isn't the charm, my love.~
@601  = ~This is getting to be a habit, Tashia. I refuse to save you any more.~
@602  = ~And I thank the gods for that.~
@603  = ~I know you were just trying to ease my despair, but pardon me if I don't laugh.~
@604  = ~You bastard! How could you say such a hateful thing? It's not like I planned this! Well, if that is how you feel about it, then I will spare you from worrying about me any further.~
@605  = ~Elhan!  I've the half vampire body of Tashia here because of you!  You'll tell me now!~
@606  = ~A friend is afflicted by vampirism.  An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know something about that.~
@607  = ~Have you come seeking wisdom from the Binder of What is Known? The Wise God stands ready.~
@608  = ~No, thank you, I have no need of help at the moment.~
@609  = ~I lost a loved one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.  I seek a means of curing her.~
@610  = ~A loved one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find them?~
@611  = ~Someone I care about has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save them?~
@612  = ~Move yer candy ass out of my way, long ears, or else ye will find me axe buried up to the hilt in yer skull...~
@613  = ~Oh, and why is that, you gnarled dirt-grubber?~
@614  = ~The answer be very simple, tree hugger. If I have to spend another minute with yer yammering without a protective layer of ale to fortify me, I shall start swinging me axe.~
@615  = ~You know, I could assist you by planting it in your pointy head.~
@616  = ~Ye better count yer blessings, bat-ears, that I be more thirsty for alcohol than blood at the moment.~
@617  = ~(Korgan sits down and proceeds to down several steins of ale.)~
@618  = ~Barkeep... two for me.~
@619  = ~And just what do ye think yer doing? ~
@620  = ~I'm just taking my refreshment here... got a problem with that, half-pint?~
@621  = ~Whatever... just don't stink up the bar with yer flowers.~
@622  = ~(As time passes, Korgan notices how much Tashia is putting away)~
@623  = ~Yer not doing too badly there for a la-dee-da flower kisser.~
@624  = ~Well, I have to have a way to keep the bile from rising into my mouth due to present company.~
@625  = ~At least ye got spirit, long ears, I'll grant ye that.~
@626  = ~Don't try to sweet talk me, Korgan. Tell you what... up for a friendly wager?~
@627  = ~And what's that?~
@628  = ~I got 100 gold pieces that says 'I can drink you under the table'.~
@629  = ~Har har! Are ye serious? If ye are, then put yer money where yer mouth is, girlie.~
@630  = ~(Tashia places her coins on the bar, Korgan matches it, and they both start to drink. Several hours pass, but by this point, their 'friendly' wager is forgotten, and in fact, they both start to sing, Korgan in a guttural bass, and Tashia in a high soprano)~
@631  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Can you throw them over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?
Do your balls hang low?

Ting-a-ling, here's a lesson
That you best not be forgettin'
If you can't get it up for a lovin' session,
Tarragon and gingsing,
Will fortify your dink,
Do your balls hang low?~
@632  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Do they make a lusty clamor
When you hit them with a hammer?
Do your balls hang low?

Ting-a-ling, all you women
If you want some sexy sinnin'
Use your cotton sheets
Not your satin linen,
Cause you will get a lumpy head
From slipping off the bed,
Do your balls hang low?~
@633  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Do they have a hollow sound
When you drag them on the ground?

And a beer would hit the spot
To be followed with a triple whiskey shot
But if you want to stick with beer
Hold your licker by the ears
Do your balls hang low?...~
@634  = ~Ooh, by the goddess... it feels like I got run over by a herd of cattle. Did anyone see the driver of that donkey cart?~
@635  = ~Okay, now where did I get this horned helmet?~
@636  = ~AAARGH! Where did these pink knickers come from!?!~
@637  = ~Stop it!~
@638  = ~Stop what?~
@639  = ~Yer getting that beetle-like look on yer bleeding face, pointy-ears, and I don't like it.~
@640  = ~By the gods, I have no idea what you are babbling about, Korgan.~
@641  = ~Ye don't? I donnae believe you. Every time yer ears twitch, and yer face scrunches up like a used up dish rag, ye then have to spout off yer latest riddle or some other twaddle.~
@642  = ~Well, I hate to disappoint you, gritsucker, but I wasn't thinking about that. Truth be known, I was thinking of someone else... someone you reminded me of.~
@643  = ~And who would this poor sod be?~
@644  = ~Ever heard of Gordian Knotbreaker? He lived a long time ago, but was considered one of the greatest riddle solvers ever lived.~
@645  = ~I told ye that I dinnae want to hear clap-trap on any riddles.~
@646  = ~And you won't, not really. You see, he lived in a time when his country was engulfed by ruin and revolt. The high king had died, and no legitimate heir had been found. In despair, the priests prayed with all their might for an answer to their problems.~
@647  = ~Yer boring me, girlie, and I still be needing to sharpen me axe. Perhaps I will use yer skull.~
@648  = ~The next morning, a massive knot was found on the altar along with a scroll saying that whoever could undo the knot was the rightful ruler.~
@649  = ~Picking a king by whoever could undo a knot? Ye got to be joking.~
@650  = ~That was the way it was, though. So everyone came to try and untie the knot. They found no end to the knot so they could untie it, and magic proved ineffective. Not until Gordian came up, you see. He spat in his hands, picked up his axe...~
@651  = ~And cut the priests off at the knees?~
@652  = ~And cut the knot in half, thereby becoming king.~
@653  = ~Finally, someone who didn't have his head up his bloody arse!~
@654  = ~Well, sometimes the best solution is the direct one.~
@655  = ~But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east...~
@656  = ~So help me, if you say, 'Tashia is the sun...' I shall kick you so far where the sun don't shine that my foot will be coming out of your mouth.~
@657  = ~Why, fair elf, do the words displease you?~
@658  = ~Only when they have been done to death. How often do you think that I can hear things like

O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head

or some other such nonsense? I mean...sure, it may be a well turned phrase, but it gets boring after a while.~
@659  = ~Forgive me, then. I was but complimenting your beauty--~
@660  = ~Why is it all bards always have to compliment a woman on her beauty? Why don't you guys try something original for a change. I mean, I'm sure even Milil gets tired of hearing the same thing day after day.~
@661  = ~Calm down, my swan...~
@662  = ~Every single time, it is usually some variation about a figure that won't quit. From there, the list expands to include skin like satin, hair of the softest gold, and a chest fit for a herd of cows. You think we like being described in a way similar to livestock?~
@663  = ~LTashia, you are taking this much too seriously!~
@664  = ~Oh really? Can I help it if it feels like you bards have some other agenda? It's almost always the woman who needs rescuing. It is always the woman who is the wicked stepmother. Either you guys want to keep us safe in a box, or bury us in one... six feet under.~
@665  = ~You better not say 'that time of the month...' either.~
@666  = ~I wouldn't even give it a half a day...~
@667  = ~Okay, Viconia, I give. Just what wouldn't take even half a day?~
@668  = ~It is nothing much, surfacer. I was just considering how long it would take to make you break on the rack...~
@669  = ~Oh, and you estimate that I wouldn't last even half a day? I'm so glad that you think so highly of me.~
@670  = ~Oh, don't act so insulted.~
@671  = ~That's right, isn't it. You participated in their bloodsports, didn't you? That explains it entirely.~
@672  = ~Believe it or not, I did find their practices distasteful, but when a matron mother is overlooking your shoulder, you learn quickly how long a victim will last. When to apply the last stroke of the lash, when to pull the last turn of the crank...~
@673  = ~You are quite proud of this, I take it?~
@674  = ~Of course, ibblith. I survived when many of my sisters did not, let alone many others. One who is not strong and adaptable soon finds themselves amongst the lower ranks, or discarded, like so much refuse.~
@675  = ~Well, I won't deny your strength. But for all the competition, all the strife, the drow are not exactly commanding too many surface kingdoms, now are they?~
@676  = ~That is true. Don't think I am foolish enough to disagree with the obvious. That constant is also one of our greatest weaknesses. One doesn't need to be a tactical genius to see that. Our conflicts amongst ourselves does little to allow our power to be extended... and our treachery is so legendary that even normal enemies will band together to weaken us, bring us down if at all possible. But, even with all of this, it is a testament to our prowess that we still survive.~
@677  = ~Well, pardon me if I don't exactly sing the exploits of your prowess...~
@678  = ~Hmmm...~
@679  = ~Aerie, would you mind telling me what is on your mind? you seem to be elsewhere, at least mentally.~
@680  = ~Oh, its nothing, or I don't think it is. It's just that as we left that last town, while everyone was busy getting supplies and everything, I was refilling our canteens when there was a man, eyeing the passing traffic. He might have been a thief, since he seemed to be taking in everything that went by. Anyways, he looked directly at me, and he seemed to get this weird... I hesitate at calling it a smile, but he gave this smile, walked over, grasped my hands, and said, 'I have faced powerful spirits, magical beasts, and evil men, but 'twas your eyes, milady, which finally smote me.~
@681  = ~And what did you do?~
@682  = ~What could I do? All I remember is that time seemed to stop, and I spent a lot of time looking down at my feet... and then I heard someone calling my name to keep up, and I hurried to catch up. But the man seemed bemused by my blush.~
@683  = ~(Tashia smiles, though there is a tight edge to it) Sounds like someone just tried a pick up line on you.~
@684  = ~A pick-up line?~
@685  = ~Yeah, that's where a stranger tries to talk with you, mainly because he finds you attractive and would like to get to know you better.~
@686  = ~But why? Why would someone try to talk to me in that way... at all? I mean... why would anyone...~
@687  = ~Not that women are to my taste, but I think the answer is very simple, Aerie. You are a beautiful woman... too be honest, I'm surprised that someone hasn't tried to be with you as it is.~
@688  = ~Funny. They may think that... but they don't know that I'm deformed.~
@689  = ~At least you had a decent first line. Mine was much worse...~
@690  = ~What do you mean?~
@691  = ~How would you have reacted if someone told you 'Pardon me, madam, but your beauty has caused an involuntary lowering of my drawbridge. If I show you where the handle, is can you crank it back up?~
@692  = ~Oh, my.~
@693  = ~So Haer'Dalis, did you practice much to become the man mothers warn their daughters of, or does it come naturally?~
@694  = ~You cut me to the quick with such an unwarranted jab. Why the hostility?~
@695  = ~Excuse me, then. It's just that you remind me of my... former leman.~
@696  = ~At least it is nice to know the resentment you harbor isn't entirely of my making. Still, I am curious, what is it about my manner that sets you most at unease?~
@697  = ~If you really want to know, it is your silver tongue.~
@698  = ~Then I think I see the problem. You were but an innocent maid, when your beau came into your life, and spoke honeyed words.~
@699  = ~(whispers) Your lips are like red wine, I should like to drink from them.~
@700  = ~Your eyes are like sparkling pools, I would like to bathe in their beauty.~
@701  = ~See what I mean?!? You even know the exact same lines.~
@702  = ~If it is any solace, Tashia, know that the lines aren't that original. Your erstwhile paramour would have taken them from another source. Why, I can easily think of at least three major works in which those lines are quoted.~
@703  = ~And I guess you could have come up with something better?~
@704  = ~Well, it perforce would depend on my intent. As I have come to know you, I would know to appeal to your intellect, that part of you which enjoys riddles and wordplay, as well as appeal to your sense of joy. For example, if I was to recast the line, I might have said something along the lines of...~
@705  = ~Your lips are like red wine, I should like to drink from them. Your eyes are like sparkling pools, I should like to bathe in their beauty. Your hair is like a field of golden wheat, I should like to cut it, thresh it, and bake it into muffins.~
@706  = ~Silver tongue and a rapier wit, especially to bring me out of my mood. You are a dangerous man, Haer'Dalis.~
@707  = ~One must play to one's audience, my swan.~
@708  = ~Tashia, is everything alright?~
@709  = ~What? Yes, yes everything is alright Aerie.~
@710  = ~Are you sure? You seemed preoccupied.~
@711  = ~I...I will be fine Aerie. I was just thinking. Thinking and remembering.~
@712  = ~About Arilistan?~
@713  = ~I must have been talking in my sleep again, but yes, I was thinking about him.~
@714  = ~If he brought you such pain, why do you think of him?~
@715  = ~He was my first love, Aerie. That is something a woman never forgets. A person can have many loves, but the first one is always special, though not always in a good way.~
@716  = ~If... if it would help, you can always talk to me.~
@717  = ~I appreciate the offer Aerie, but this is something I'm going to have to muddle through on my own.~
@718  = ~Okay Tashia, I will leave you be. However, even I know the hurts of the soul, the head, the heart can be more dangerous than the wounds of the body.~
@719  = ~You're a good friend, Aerie. When... when I'm ready, I will tell you.~
@720  = ~Mazzy, may I ask a question?~
@721  = ~Sure you may. In fact, I think you just did.~
@722  = ~Why Mazzy, a joke... I didn't think you had it in you.~
@723  = ~Well, I may not be as adept as you at constructing a fair turn of phrase, Tashia, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a well crafted phrase.~
@724  = ~Oh, its like anything else, I imagine. Whatever you put your mind to, you can usually learn.~
@725  = ~Yes, although I can understand the urge of a crowd if a jester gets up there and starts asking, 'Why do knights ride stallions in the day?' and the inevitable reply is, 'Because they don't like nightmares'. Anyways, you said you wanted to ask me something?~
@726  = ~Yes, I did. Well, with all that we've been through, it seems like I'm using my magic more and more. And with that period in Trademeet... well, would it be possible for you to help me get my staff work back up to par?~
@727  = ~Sure, Tashia, I wouldn't mind... but are you sure? I'm sure there are plenty of others in the party that could help you just as easily.~
@728  = ~No, there really isn't. The last time I asked for help, the fool put his arms around me, and grabbing the staff with both hands said, 'Fighting is like everything else : it's all in your thrust...~
@729  = ~I hope you put the churl in his place.~
@730  = ~Well, last I heard, they managed to find a cleric good enough. But walking with a dislocated kneecap has to be painful...~
@731  = ~Say Tashia, you may have heard of my deeds with the Hillgnasher Giants. But have you also heard...~
@732  = ~Anomen, give it a rest already.~
@733  = ~Something wrong, milady?~
@734  = ~I'm sure I'm not the only one that has felt this way, and I'm sure that you are probably correct in your deeds. Indeed, if true, then there is reason to be proud... but that doesn't mean you should be so boastful about it.~
@735  = ~Me, boastful? Those are harsh words, my lady. How can it be boasting when it is simply the truth?~
@736  = ~Truth or not, but that seems to be the only thing coming out of your mouth. As I already said, there is nothing wrong with taking pride in your deeds, but if that is the only thing that you can talk about, then you live a mighty empty life. Frankly, its a wonder...~
@737  = ~If that is the case, then why is it that most of the ladies back in Amn hung on my very word?~
@738  = ~Well, as it's unlikely I'll be able to hobnob around the rich and famous, I can only hazard a guess or two. But the first is that some of them were genuinely interested...~
@739  = ~But, you just said...~
@740  = ~Of course I said that it sounds very arrogant to talk of your exploits time after time, but that doesn't mean others don't find them fascinating. Have you considered the circumstances of the average woman of nobility?~
@741  = ~Consider?~
@742  = ~The average noblewoman tends to lead a very boring life, compared to the men, anyways. Unless they have an understanding father, or are strong enough to set out on their own. There is a very small range of allowable behavior for them. You don't see too many noble ladies taking up a life of adventuring, now do you?~
@743  = ~Well, no.~
@744  = ~Of course not. I mean, it seems to me that a woman is mainly expected to solidify social connections, and assure the next generation of nobles. Hell, even ones that are into horse riding, hunting, or falconry are looked down on just a bit as well.~
@745  = ~You are right.~
@746  = ~Anyways, to get back to my point... when you tell your stories - and you do tell them rather energetically and vividly at that, even if it gets old after a while of the same thing - you draw them into in, and for a brief moment, you show them a life that doesn't bind them.~
@747  = ~But then, what am I supposed to tell them... afterwards?~
@748  = ~Tough nut there, I admit. I mean, when I think of women of 'high station', I get images of obsessive weavers and compulsive dressmakers in mind. Maybe you can break the ice with a joke.~
@749  = ~A joke? Surely you jest!~
@750  = ~And I would stay away from the bad puns.~
@751  = ~(hums)Golden slumber kiss your eyes, smiles await you when you rise.
Sleep, do not cry, and I'll sing you a lullaby.~
@752  = ~Tashia, please stop...~
@753  = ~Care you know not, therefore sleep, while I o'er you watch do keep...~
@754  = ~Damn it, stop it, Tashia!~
@755  = ~What? What's wrong, Anomen?~
@756  = ~That song! Why were you humming that song?~
@757  = ~I was just thinking of my sister. She...she used to like that song. Mother used to sing it to her before bed.~
@758  = ~Used to?~
@759  = ~She...she died of the pox. I...I held her hand as she went to sleep. Mother cradled her...~
@760  = ~Shh. It's alright, Tashia. Please forgive my outburst. Go ahead, and sing it. I shall keep silent.~
@761  = ~Are you sure? I mean, you were really angry--~
@762  = ~Proceed as you will. Maybe, someday, I will tell you of the gentlest, kindest woman I've known.~
@763  = ~Tashia, have I ever told you that you are coming quite nicely into your powers? Why, with just the proper instruction, I'm sure that you may even be worthy of being in my presence. (Yes, let's see how she reacts to my proposal.)~
@764  = ~Okay, Edwin, I'm just getting a bit tired, so I don't really have the energy to verbally joust with you. What are you getting at?~
@765  = ~Nothing, my dear, just stating the obvious. Why, with the proper training, as I just said, you could certainly deserve...~
@766  = ~You do realize that I'm not a proper wizard? Just how do you expect me to learn spells when all my magic comes from within?~
@767  = ~That's just it, Tashia... your power comes from within, it's as if you internalize all your spellbooks. Imagine what a wondrous advantage that is. Though it shames me to admit it, at times even I can see where that ability is greater than sheer memorization.~
@768  = ~The great Edwin, admitting shame? Okay, who are you, and what have you done to the real Edwin?~
@769  = ~Hear me out. It could be that as you grow stronger, the spells you display are founded on some internal desires. Why, if we could just channel that...~
@770  = ~And how would we channel that?~
@771  = ~Well, why don't you come to my bedroll this evening, and I will give you your first lesson.~
@772  = ~Edwin, I will give you some points for subtlety, at least for you. However,thanks, but no thanks. I'm afraid that you will have to sleep alone once more this evening.~
@773  = ~(Damn. So close, yes, so close...)~
@774  = ~Something is wrong with these grapes. Its even worse than biting into a lime.~
@775  = ~Hmmm. Well, first thing, there is nothing wrong with this bush.~
@776  = ~What do you mean, "There is nothing wrong"?~
@777  = ~This is moonseed. Its fruit looks like grapes, but it isn't. In small amounts it is actually a good laxative. As I'm sure you will find out...~
@778  = ~What do you mean, "I will find out"?~
@779  = ~Just be glad you didn't eat more than a small handful. It could cause purging.~
@780  = ~I see...~
@781  = ~Come, Tashia, I didn't think you were that hard of hearing. I said that it was a diarrhetic. I highly recommend that when you... leave, you keep an eye out for the poison sumac.~
@782  = ~Isn't there anything you can do to help me?~
@783  = ~No. One shouldn't use one's spells casually. Not when the matter will resolve itself. Let... Nature take its course.~
@784  = ~Hey Nalia, what's so interesting on the ground?~
@785  = ~Oh, hi Tashia. No, there is nothing. Why do you ask?~
@786  = ~No reason, really, just that you seem a bit preoccupied. I thought maybe you found a trail of breadcrumbs or something to follow.~
@787  = ~Trail of bread... oh, that old story of the woodcutter's children putting down a trail of breadcrumbs to follow their way home. No, I was just thinking.~
@788  = ~Thinking about what Isaea said? I won't deny that I wish matters had been settled more definitely, but I also know these things take time.~
@789  = ~There is that. But that wasn't what I was thinking of, it's just... I don't think I can repay anyone for all that has happened.~
@790  = ~What do you mean, repay?~
@791  = ~Well, it was easy when you all defeated the trolls. After they were defeated, I gave you your gold as a reward. But you saving me from Isaea... I don't know that if there is any way I can pay you all back anytime soon.~
@792  = ~Nalia... whoever said anything about paying us back?~
@793  = ~What? Did I say something wrong? I'm sorry, but I guess you guys don't really know me all that well. But I do repay my debts.~
@794  = ~I am sure that you do, Nalia. But this isn't about repaying debts, not like that.~
@795  = ~What do you mean? Well, if you guys want something else, I could probably find something else. Sell a few heirlooms...~
@796  = ~No, Nalia. We didn't do any of that because we expected recompense, we did that because we were friends. Well, I can't speak for any of the others, I guess... but I'm sure <CHARNAME> did it for the same reason I did: that we don't like something hurting our friends.~
@797  = ~Friends?~
@798  = ~Yes, Nalia, friends. Is that so hard to believe? I would like to think we are friends.~
@799  = ~Friends... we are friends, aren't we?~
@800  = ~Certainly.~
@801  = ~Friends. I didn't really have friends, growing up that is. Oh, there was Baunchy and such, but he was really Father's friend. Aunty ruined any friends I might have made with the commoner kids, always going on a tirade about how I was ruining myself and Father. Well, I loved him of course... but ever since mother died, Father threw himself into his business more than anything else. And whatever Aunty wanted, he gave her, just to keep her out of earshot.~
@802  = ~I'm sorry.~
@803  = ~Don't say it. Don't say you're sorry when you had nothing to do with it.~
@804  = ~But I know what you meant, and I thank you for it.~
@805  = ~So, Tashia, what do friends tend to talk about?~
@806  = ~Whatever comes to their mind actually. Heh, why I remember talking with my sister. You know that I had five siblings... we originally went traveling together. Anyways, she had this crush on the boy. I thought he was a bit slow myself, but I must admit, he was easy on the eyes...~
@807  = ~So you're Imoen! I'm pleased to meet you. To be honest, I was wondering whether you really were alive or not.~
@808  = ~Heh, well, I was wondering what was keeping <CHARNAME>... its not like <PRO_HIMHER> to be so late.~
@809  = ~Heh, you know, you remind me of my younger sister.~
@810  = ~Really, I do? Younger sister, huh. Just how many brothers and sisters did you have?~
@811  = ~There were five of us altogether. We were orphans really, but one family took us in. Heh, sometimes I wonder what possessed my foster parents to take us all in.~
@812  = ~Just like <CHARNAME> and I with Gorion. Well, truth be known, mainly me. Not that <PRO_HESHE> didn't have <PRO_HISHER> moments, but <PRO_HESHE> was always more serious of the two of us.~
@813  = ~Yeah, you know. I remember back... oh, I must have been about 12... anyways, with so many kids there, money could get to be quite tight. Well, my older brother, Ilyan, had this great idea that would save us time and money. When we weren't doing chores around the house or anything like that, Ilyan usually was drafted to watch us, being the oldest of us all. But he also loved fishing. It wasn't until he got the rest of us hooked that we were able to supplement the dinner table. Anyways, Ilyan got the idea that instead of constantly trying to catch fish for the table, it would be better for us to raise our own.~
@814  = ~I think I see where this is heading...~
@815  = ~Of course. So, one day while our foster parents went to town to sell our produce and such, we all went out back and dug a big hole. Probably wasn't no more than 5 feet wide, maybe 3 feet deep, but it seemed like it was much larger. That's a lot of dirt for a group of kids to move. Anyways, we then took buckets of water and started filling it. Anyways, we were about done when our foster parents came in. Well, nothing more happened, dinner was served and whatever. Anyways, it starts to get late, and so we go to bed. The sun had just set, and our foster father needed to go use the privy... did I mention it's an outdoor privy? Next thing we know, we hear screaming and swearing coming from outside, and our foster father is busy bellowing for us all to come down.~
@816  = ~I gather you didn't keep your ditch?~
@817  = ~Of course not. You see, once he calmed down, our foster-father said that since we liked digging so much, we could muck out the barn. I swear, we couldn't get rid of the odor for a week from our clothes.~
@818  = ~(sigh)~
@819  = ~What's wrong, Tashia?~
@820  = ~Oh, it's nothing. Melancholy mostly. Nothing serious.~
@821  = ~Are you sure? We can talk about it if you wish.~
@822  = ~Well, it's just that today was my stepmother's birthday. She took us in, my stepbrothers and stepsisters, I mean. Heh, of course, it used to drive me nuts trying to find a gift that she didn't already have, or one my siblings got for her.~
@823  = ~Heh, I know the feeling. It wasn't much different back at Candlekeep. Why, on Gorion's birthday... no, maybe it would be better not to say anything.~
@824  = ~You already mentioned it, Imoen. You can't hold back now.~
@825  = ~I guess I can't, at that. Well, you have to understand, there weren't very many children at Candlekeep, and so we were under the care of various researchers and teachers. As a result, we didn't exactly have much leeway in gifts.~
@826  = ~I can see where that would be a problem.~
@827  = ~You don't know the half of it. Anyways, it was Gorion's birthday, and it was a big to do. One kid, he was studying under the priest of Oghma, brought forth a box, and Gorion shook it, saying, 'I know what it is. I bet it is a book.' The boy said, 'That's right'. Then one of the scullery maids came with a box, and Gorion held it up, and said, 'I bet I know what it is. Is it candy?' 'That's right' said the maid.~
@828  = ~And then it was your turn?~
@829  = ~Yes, it was. Anyways, I gave my box to Gorion, and he noticed it was leaking. He touched a drop with his finger and tasted it. 'I bet I know what it is,' he said, 'is it wine?~
@830  = ~Wine?~
@831  = ~Well, I was staying with Winthrop at the time. He was the innkeeper at Candlekeep, as well as the chief bartender.~
@832  = ~Which is why Gorion would guess there was wine in it.~
@833  = ~Except that it wasn't wine. Imagine Gorion's surprise when he found a puppy within.~
@834  = ~Hey Yoshimo, I am curious. You're not from around here, are you?~
@835  = ~Indeed I am not, Tashia. Tell me, what gave it away? Was it my accent that gave it away? Or was it my swarthy, if rather handsome appearance? Maybe it was...~
@836  = ~Okay, okay, I kinda walked right into that one. Tell me, though, where are you from? I come from the lands of the Ten Towns, much further to the north. One thing I can say I don't honestly miss too much is the constant cold.~
@837  = ~A man in my line of work must be a bit careful who they tell information to, but you seem honest enough. Truth be known, I come from Kara-Tur.~
@838  = ~Kara-Tur? Funny, you don't sound how I would imagine one from Kara-Tur would sound like.~
@839  = ~Oh? And just how would you expect us to sound? Not all of us go around sounding like we are speaking in broken phrases like. If I went around saying things like:

Autumn winds dance in the sky
The leaves fall frosted with ice
The swallows return south

I could guarantee that half of my business would be cut as they waded through the swamp of my language.~
@840  = ~Yeah, heh. I guess I really should have given it some thought. But coming to Amn, isn't that a bit out of the ways to go to from Kara-Tur?~
@841  = ~Indeed it is. I spent many a night aboard ship, too many nights it felt like sometimes. Though I was glad to make landfall... as was the crew.~
@842  = ~Really? And why that would be?~
@843  = ~Oh, it had a little something to do with their gambling debts. Why, I bet that if I would have had one more week, I would have been the proud owner of a large, if smelly fishing trawler.~
@844  = ~And just what would you have done with that ship?~
@845  = ~I don't know. Maybe turn it into a riverboat gambler - one that reeks of dead fish.~
@846  = ~Yoshimo, would you say you are a good bounty hunter?~
@847  = ~Good enough, for Yoshimo stands before you, does he not? He didn't die of starvation for losing his quarry, nor does he lie in some forgotten alley, a knife in his back.~
@848  = ~Heh, ask a stupid question...~
@849  = ~Was there a particular reason you asked me that question?~
@850  = ~Actually, there was another one I wanted to ask, but was unsure how to phrase it. Ever since we've met, you seem confident of your abilities, and for good reason. I was just curious if there was a time or two when your quarry got the better of you.~
@851  = ~You honor me with your praise, but you are right that not all my hunts have been successful. Take my fourth assignment... no, it was the fifth assignment as an example. I was hired to find someone who owed my principal a great deal of money.~
@852  = ~I expect you probably had to chase him into the woods or something.~
@853  = ~No, not really. You see, the man I was looking for actually worked a couple towns over as a tea-master at a local shrine. I pretended to make a social call on my quarry, and was invited to tea.~
@854  = ~Invited to tea? Why would you be invited to tea?~
@855  = ~It is a ceremony common to those parts, and no disrespect intended Tashia, the significance of which may be lost on you. As I said, I was invited to tea. Little did I know how proficient my quarry was at his craft. Upon my entrance, the tea-master knew something was amiss, and politely asked me to leave my sword outside for the ceremony.~
@856  = ~I gather it didn't exactly go down that way? Let me guess, you refused and then there was one splattered tea-master lying on the ground of the shrine.~
@857  = ~You rush the tale, but no, events didn't unfold the way you surmised. You were correct in assuming I kept my sword by my side. As I explained to the tea-master, I was a warrior, and would never be parted from my blade. The tea-master nodded sagely, and invited me in, sword and all. The tea pot started to whistle...and the tea-master suddenly tipped it over. Hissing steam rose and filled the room with smoke and ashes.~
@858  = ~And the tea-master ducked out in the ensuing clamor?~
@859  = ~That was my first thought. So I ran outside to find him--only to find he wasn't there, nor was my sword. Turning around, I saw the tea-master still in the teahouse. He bowed before me, and said, 'It was my mistake. Come back in and have some tea. I have your sword covered with ashes, and will clean it and give it back to you.'~
@860  = ~So what did you do afterwards?~
@861  = ~There was little else I could do, but go back and enjoy my tea.~
@862  = ~Hey Minsc, do they enjoy stories from where you are from?~
@863  = ~When the skalds stir to play, any true warrior of Rasheman heeds to their tales! Why, even Boo's righteous passion is quelled when they speak.~
@864  = ~Oh, I just want your opinion on a story. A man walks into an inn, and he orders a steak. The serving wench gave him a quick once over, and she said, 'I don't think so... you don't look like you can afford a glass of water, let alone a steak.' The guy nods in agreement, but replies, 'But what if I show you something that you haven't seen before, will you then give me my supper?~
@865  = ~Hmm... Boo says that one really should have the money to pay for their dinner.~
@866  = ~And Boo is one intelligent hamster. Now please let me continue... so, anyways, the waitress agrees and the man reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a tiny harpsichord and from the other a small hamster.~
@867  = ~Ooooh, this may be one of Boo's relatives. You didn't tell me you had a musician in the family.~
@868  = ~Yes, yes... well, the hamster starts to play up a storm and the waitress' eyes open wide, and she calls the innkeeper to come take a look. Everyone in the inn is now looking at the hamster, but the man reaches into a third pocket, and pulls out a green item... he places it on the counter, and everyone sees that it is a frog, and as the hamster plays, the frog starts to sing.~
@869  = ~A singing frog? Boo has never heard of such a one before.~
@870  = ~A wealthy merchant saw what was happening, and he said, 'How much for the frog and hamster?' The stranger shook his head, and said that the hamster wasn't for sale, but he could part with the frog for 300 gold pieces. As the greedy merchant went to his room, the waitress looked at the stranger, and asked, 'Are you insane? Giving up a singing frog for that much? It must have been worth thousands.' The stranger smiled, and he said, 'No, it wasn't. The hamster is a ventriloquist.~
@871  = ~A ventriloquist? Say it can't be so! The hamster is a foul thief! Boo's fur is all wiry in righteous anger! If we meet up with this deceptive rodent, we must apply the boots of justice to his backside!~
@872  = ~Hey Tashia, did you ever hear...~
@873  = ~Let me guess, Jan, this is going to be some pointless story about one of your myriad relatives. It shall go on and on, without any end in sight, involving some kind of small, vaguely round vegetable?~
@874  = ~Tashia, you cut me to the quick. Why, this story doesn't involve anything that you just said.~
@875  = ~Okay, Jan, what is it, then?~
@876  = ~As I was going to say, I was going to ask if you ever heard of my cousin Bjorn. Rather good with his hands, expert locksmith. Anyways, there was this king who was going off to war. Unsure how long he would be, and worried about the... fidelity of his new wife, he commissioned Bjorn to create a chastity belt.~
@877  = ~Heh, as if that would stop a truly determined lady.~
@878  = ~Normally, it wouldn't. However, I did say that Bjorn was an expert locksmith. When the king came to see Bjorn's creation, he was rather surprised to find a rather large hole in the most obvious of places. That which a chastity belt was meant to guard against.~
@879  = ~Really? I would think that an opening at that... orifice would rather defeat the whole purpose of having the belt.~
@880  = ~Indeed. But I did say that was Bjorn rather resourceful. Upon seeing the king's disbelief, Bjorn reached over the workbench for his lunch, and pulled out a rather large turnip. He slid the turnip into the gaping hole, which resulted in a whistle in the air, and a satisfying snick. Pulling his hand back, Bjorn showed that half of the turnip was cut clear in half, and pointing at the hole, revealed a rather sharp blade.~
@881  = ~Ouch...~
@882  = ~Certainly. Anyways, the king was well pleased with Bjorn's invention, and he doubled the salary he was paying my cousin. Of course, as he had no intention of paying him anything, Bjorn spent the next few years in the dungeon. Anyways, the king finally came back from his years at war and assembled his knights. He had them drop their drawers for an inspection, and much to his chagrin, everyone of them was mutilated in some fashion... all but one knight, his brother actually.~
@883  = ~I think I see where this is going.~
@884  = ~Oh yes. The king embraced his brother in a manly hug, pleased that at least one man was loyal to him. The king smiled, saying, 'Since you were the only one who kept faith with me, I shall reward you with anything you want. All you have to do is say what you want.' Several minutes passed, as his brother turned his head, and the king said, 'Come, come. No need to be bashful... all you have to do is give voice to it.~
@885  = ~I should have seen this coming...~
@886  = ~So the brother opens his mouth, and says, 'Ah-buh-buh-ah-buh-buh'~
@887  = ~... Jan?~
@888  = ~Yes, Tashia?~
@889  = ~Go away.~
@890  = ~Did you just growl, Viconia?~
@891  = ~Not at you, iblith, but since you already had the temerity to broach on my thoughts, let me ask you this. How do you tolerate it?~
@892  = ~Tolerate what? Your gripes and complaints? It isn't easy, but given enough time, even Ilmater would learn to tune you out.~
@893  = ~I would have you flayed for such disrespect back home...~
@894  = ~But you aren't back home.~
@895  = ~And that is part of the problem...and a lesser concern. No, what I am asking is why you surface women allow men to continue with this nonsense of thinking they are even your equals, let alone your betters.~
@896  = ~Hmm. I don't see it that way myself, not entirely. On the other hand, I know there are plenty of women who would agree with you.~
@897  = ~Sounds like there may be sensible surfacers after all.~
@898  = ~I know one who is fond of saying, 'Men are like fine wine. They start out as sweet as grapes, then women must stomp on them and keep them in the dark, until they mature into something nice to have dinner with.~
@899  = ~Ah, she would have made a good drow, unlike simpering dolts like you. Males aren't worth much until properly broken in.~
@900  = ~Perhaps. But I would have to disagree with you. What about love? What about trust? Your way... you may live, but it would be lonely.~
@901  = ~L'alurl abbil zhah dosstan. The only one you can trust is yourself. Everything else is foolish sentimentality.~
@902  = ~Cernd, are there any civilized comforts you miss since you've become a druid?~
@903  = ~My needs are few and far between. If I am hungry, I can either hunt something down, or go gathering plants. I never feel lonely, for all of nature's creatures are there to keep me company.~
@904  = ~But needs aren't the same as comforts, are they?~
@905  = ~No, they are not. I admit there are a couple things that I do miss.~
@906  = ~Such as?~
@907  = ~(runs a hand along his cheek) Mirrors for one. Razors for another. Do you know how hard it is to keep oneself clean shaven when you only have your reflection in a pond, and a scimitar or dull knife to scrape away the hair?~
@908  = ~Ugh, I can see where that would be a problem. Not to mention all the blood...~
@909  = ~Well, I looked more like a wounded boar after the first time I shaved. The...wound...was attended to, but the healer was tempted to leave it be as an object lesson. Still, it was better than the alternative.~
@910  = ~Alternative?~
@911  = ~There was another druidess who said she found a way to keep hair from growing entirely.~
@912  = ~I hope it didn't involved any kind of potions or creams. My step-father, in a moment of vanity, bought an elixir from a traveling gnome one time. His hair grew alright, but it was the hair between his ears.~
@913  = ~No, it was nothing like that. No, the druidess said by applying a light electrical jolt to a region a certain number of times, it would kill the hair that grew there, keeping it smooth all year round.~
@914  = ~Ouch. Surely no one was stupid enough to get it done.~
@915  = ~Not to my knowledge, no.~
@916  = ~Jan, where did your family get its green thumb?~
@917  = ~You know about that, Tashia?~
@918  = ~I think everyone back in Amn knows about it.~
@919  = ~I knew that cousin Norvik couldn't be trusted. Get a little turnip juice into him, and he starts to run at the mouth. I swear, we didn't mean for gangrene to set in, but once it did, we couldn't throw it out. Waste not, want not...~
@920  = ~Jan, what in the nine hells are you rambling about? I was talking about the tree you and your family lives in. I mean, the plant was still alive.~
@921  = ~Oh, that. Well, it only requires a little TLC.~
@922  = ~TLC?~
@923  = ~Turnip, love, and care.~
@924  = ~I should have known. I should have known.~
@925  = ~You didn't strike me as the gardening type, Tashia. Look at those nails, they are more suitable for gouging out eyes than they are for digging up tubers. Now, turnip stroker... yes, you definitely would have a future there.~
@926  = ~Turnip... stroker?~
@927  = ~To achieve maximum growth...~
@928  = ~Enough, I don't want to know anymore.~
@929  = ~But you are the one that brought the subject up!~
@930  = ~No... no I didn't! Whatever. Sheesh, all I wanted to know was how you got your plants to grow so well. That way, when I got back to the Ten Towns, I could tell my mother. She loves to garden, and is always looking for an edge.~
@931  = ~Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? There is no secret. For tomatoes, it's best to expose yourself to them at least twice a day.~
@932  = ~Expose... yourself?~
@933  = ~Certainly. That way they turn red of embarrassment. Though I must warn you to be careful around cucumbers. My father did it, and quadrupled their size within the season.~
@934  = ~So, how did you do it, Keldorn? How did you manage to stay married for so many years?~
@935  = ~There is no secret, Tashia. Maria and I never went to bed angry.~
@936  = ~That's it? Surely you had to have fights and arguments.~
@937  = ~Aye, we did, but we always made up before going to bed. Of course, all was not always this way.~
@938  = ~Oh?~
@939  = ~I remember one particularly horrible argument, and we ended up not speaking to each other. It is childish in retrospect, but who said youth was ever level-headed? I had to wake early the next day, and not wanting to break the silence, I wrote a note to Maria: 'Please wake me at seven bells'.~
@940  = ~You really wanted to win bad, didn't you?~
@941  = ~Aye, that I did. Let's just say, I learned several things that night. First, sometimes it is better to concede than press a point. Second, Maria is more patient than I ever could be.~
@942  = ~What happened?~
@943  = ~I woke with the sun shining in my face and the sound of nine bells echoing in my ears. Furious, I jumped out of bed, ready to break my silence--only to see a piece of paper flutter off the bed.~
@944  = ~Teehee, I think I like the way Maria thinks.~
@945  = ~As you guessed, Maria wrote, 'It's seven bells. It's time to wake up' on the slip of paper.~
