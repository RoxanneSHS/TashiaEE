@0 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Tashia forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right...  Amaunator's idol has restored Tashia not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from her, as well.~

@1 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Tashia into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had her.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost her.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan...~

@2 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Tashia.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@3    = ~(Tashia breathes deeply as the ship comes to a full stop, and grabbing part of the rigging, she breathes in deeply, her chest swelling with the air.)~
@4    = ~Finally, land. I'll be so glad to get out of this salt air and into a warm tub...~
@5    = ~(Taking a deep breath, you notice the red flush of her cheeks, vivacious sparkle in her jade green eyes, the weariness from your sea voyage gone from her exuberant face. Between the spray of the sea and the humidity of the air, her robe clinging tightly to her body, showing her thin, tight figure, hugging her small, round breasts, rising and falling with the rocking of the boat.)~
@6    = ~(Tashia smiles, and her lips twists up slightly)
I am first mouth, then hand
Aired together for a message
That always means the same
I am sent as the crow would go
But although some pretend to catch me,
My fate is to fly forever, Never to arrive...~
@7    = ~Could it be the wind, carrying your words through the air? (Walk over to her, and run your fingers through a few links of her hair after you answer)~
@8    = ~(Smile at Tashia, kiss your palm, and blow it towards her cheek)~
@9    = ~Perhaps it is a kiss, blown through the air...~
@10   = ~Perhaps it is the wind, carrying your voice...~
@11   = ~I don't really know...~
@12   = ~(Tashia leans back into your hand, her eyes closing, a slight pleasant hum escapes from her lips) That is close, but not quite. The answer is a blown kiss.~
@13   = ~(Her eyes snap open, and she pulls away from you) Um, let's get going...~
@14   = ~(Tashia's smile grows larger and she moves, catching the kiss with a swift hand, then bringing it up, and pressing it to her cheek.)~
@15   = ~(Tashia gives a slight chuckle, her face staring fondly at yours, when she suddenly turns her head aside, cheeks burning bright red.)~
@16   = ~Sorry, we still have to finish your quest, don't we?~
@17   = ~(Tashia's face seems to lose some of its exuberance, although she still bears a slight smile) Correct. The answer is a blown kiss.~
@18   = ~(Tashia glances over the horizon) Let's get going...~
@19   = ~(Tashia's face loses a small bit of its vitality, but she shakes her head) No, it is a blown kiss. But you weren't too far off...~
@20   = ~(She gives a last glance at the sea, and then turns around) I guess we should get going...~
@21   = ~(Tashia's mouth widens, and she chuckles) Well, they say being too long at sea can addle one's wits...~
@22   = ~(She turns around, and looks out over the sea, a sigh escaping her lips) Well, looks like it's time to get back to business...~
@23   = ~(Tashia walks forward in the darkness, the warmth of her breath creating a slight fog, as she balls her fists together, then slowly lets them go. She takes one tentative step, then another forward, before turning to look at you.)~
@24   = ~Mine is the ungloved
pulsing fingertip

The shroud, the interface
of brittle leaves

Mine is the cruel purity
that snaps all iron,

Sends your warm breath
biting backwards

I am the splintered rainbow
locked in ice...~
@25   = ~(Place a reassuring hand on Tashia's shoulder) Tashia? Are you alright?~
@26   = ~(Place a reassuring hand on Tashia's shoulder) Is it frost?~
@27   = ~(Place a reassuring hand on Tashia's shoulder) Is it death?~
@28   = ~(Push Tashia forward by placing your hand on the back of her shoulder) Pull yourself together, woman. Danger surrounds us, and you want to recite poetry in the darkness.~
@29   = ~(Tashia turns around, and she squeezes your hand) I'm alright, or I will be once we get out of here. Funny, I never thought I would miss the surface so greatly. Here... it's just cold, unfeeling stone beneath my feet. I feel... disjointed... if that makes sense...~
@30   = ~(She shrugs, removing your hand from her shoulder) Let's get out of here. Who knows what dwells in the shadows...~
@31   = ~(Tashia reaches up and squeezes your hand) That is correct. Frost is the answer.~
@32   = ~(Tashia stands close to you, drawing comfort from your nearness, whispering) I guess I didn't believe the stories about how cold, how dark the Underdark is. Of course, I didn't believe I would ever come here...~
@33   = ~(She leans in closer, her other hand absent-mindedly grabbing your free hand and she gives a contented sigh.)~
@34   = ~(Tashia then blushes, as she notices just how close she is to you, and she quickly pulls away) Umm... let's get going. We still have a lot to do...~
@35   = ~(Tashia reaches, and squeezes your hand, giving a slight chuckle) Well that is a suitably morbid answer. Given our surroundings, I guess I might say the same thing...~
@36   = ~(She removes your hand from her shoulder, a strange, measuring look on her face, whispering) Heh, the answer I was looking for was frost. I don't know about you, but I'm getting a bit cold...~
@37   = ~(She sighs, and moves forward, her anxiety overcome) Let's go... I am already starting to miss the sun...~
@38   = ~(Tashia looks slightly hurt, but she shifts her stance, walking toward the front of the group) Right you are, we have better things to do in the darkness... like snapping at those around us.~
@39   = ~(Tashia seems oddly quiet after you've rescued Imoen. In fact, when your back is turned, you definitely get the feeling of being watched, and when you turn your head to glance around, you see Tashia jerk her head to focus her attention on something else.)~
@40   = ~(Ignore her. If she's got anything on her mind, she'll let you know.)~
@41   = ~(Go up to her, resting a hand on her shoulder) Is something wrong Tashia?~
@42   = ~(Tashia gives a wan smile) Oh I'm alright. I was just doing some remembering, that's all. You're close to her, aren't you? Imoen I mean...~
@43   = ~Close? Don't make me laugh... she's been a constant pain in the ass ever since we left Candlekeep. I tried to send her home way back when... but she insisted on following me and look where it got her...~
@44   = ~Of course we are close. She was the sister I never had. Well, growing up an orphan and all that. Don't get me wrong... Gorion was a good man, but let's just say that his idea of a good time was to curl up with a good book. Heh, sometimes I wonder how he could stand the two of us, let alone just myself growing up...~
@45   = ~(Tashia's eyes flash angrily) Is that all she is to you? Is that the only reason you have her around?~
@46   = ~(Her eyes narrow) Is that how you see me? As some kind of camp follower? Someone to sate your lust with? Someone who will take an arrow for you when we're ambushed?~
@47   = ~Of course. You know what my quest is. It's paramount that Irenicus is stopped, at all costs. As it is, I stand the best chance of taking him down, but even I can get taken out any time. The more people in the party, the greater the individual chances of our survival.~
@48   = ~(smirk) No, I'm just kidding. If that's all I thought of her, would I have risked life and limb to come rescue her?~
@49   = ~(Tashia's face grows livid) To hell with you! I am not going to be some kind of damn target for an arrogant, insufferable bastard like you...~
@50   = ~I should have known better... you Bhaalspawn are all the same... the next time we meet... we are enemies...~
@51   = ~(Tashia shakes her head forlornly) I didn't find that at all humorous... I like Imoen, and you really shouldn't say a thing like that... not with all she's gone through...~
@52   = ~(Tashia steps back, and looks at you, as if making a decision, and nods to herself.)~
@53   = ~(Tashia smiles at your words) Heh, well I think all parents are like that. My foster parents were exactly the same way. Why, I remember the day we all climbed to the roof, pretending we could fly. I learned that day I wasn't an Avariel...~
@54   = ~(Tashia blushes as she subconsciously rubs her backside) Let's just say I think I have a good idea what an ass-kicking feels like...~
@55   = ~Heh... that's pretty good Tashia. Yeah, sometimes I wonder how we ever managed to finish childhood myself. Why, I remember that Phlydia, she was one of the monks at Candlekeep, had her birthday coming up... early spring now that I think of it... I completely forgot about it until Imoen mentioned it. Well, I suddenly had a brainstorm. I decided to pick a bunch of wildflowers for her! I found some nice flowers, and bound them together, but I also saw this shrub that had some pretty red leaves...~
@56   = ~(shake your head) Well, I never really had too many episodes growing up truth be known...~
@57   = ~(Tashia's grin goes wide) Heh... well, you know, girls always do like flowers...~
@58   = ~(She lays her hand on your shoulder, and winks at you, whispering) If you ever have an itch to scratch... I will... relieve you...~
@59   = ~(Tashia pulls on your arm, whispering into your ear) Can you give me a few minutes? There is something further I must do...~
@60   = ~(She walks a little ways away from you, kneeling on the ground, and she starts to dig in the ground, her eyes closed, as she murmurs...)~
@61   = ~I commend the soul of one long lost
Into thine embrace, She of the Luminous Cloud

He was lost in the winter
Dwelling in isolation

He would not see
That autumn is not
Cold enough to
Destroy desire...~
@62   = ~Memories so old
He would waken
Darkness within
Driving him beneath the sky

He did not want to die
Bound in greed and madness
Conscience and sadness
Bound deep within

I beseech of you,
Daughter of the Nightsky
Lead him to the coming spring...~
@63   = ~(As the last of the words come from her lips, Tashia reaches into her robe, pulling out a small silvery locket from her pocket, and she raises it to her lips, giving it a kiss, before putting it in the hole, covering it with the freshly dug soil. A single, silvery tear courses down her face, and dots the earth.)~
@64   = ~(She whispers) May Sehanine Moonbow help your soul, Arilistan...~
@65   = ~(With a sigh, Tashia rises, and she leans into the crook of your arm, her arm entwined in yours) Okay, let's go.~
@66   = ~(Tashia starts becoming more and more like her own self again, after the events that Arilistan forced upon her, and her subsequent resurrection. However, you definitely catch slight glimpses from the corner of your eye, as Tashia glances fondly at you, and then turns her head to return to the matter at hand.)~
@67   = ~(As you travel, Tashia moves closer as well, occasionally slipping her hand into yours, and in one such instance, she pulls you aside from the group, momentarily, and says) I never thought I would have fallen in love again... it's almost as if it was god sent.~
@68   = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide, as she whispers) Maybe... goddess sent?~
@69   = ~(Shaking her head, her long blonde hair momentarily covering her eyes, she bites her lip deep in thought, obviously thinking on the matter, as she mutters) It just could be... and even if not... I shouldn't take any chances...~
@70   = ~(Tashia smiles at you) Would you mind humoring me for just a second?~
@71   = ~ (Tashia raises your right palm to face hers, then your left, her feet paralleling yours. She starts to kiss you, first along the length of your hand, starting with the tip of your fingers, slowly making her way to your palm. Her other hand traces along your other hand, as she says...)~
@72   = ~I voice my appreciation
O, Lady Goldheart
For granting your blessing unto me

I am saved,
Saved from false assumption
Saved from being lost.~
@73   = ~(By this point, Tashia is kissing along your shoulder, taking a special moment to kiss the crook of your shoulder and neck, her other hand now entwined with yours, lowered to your sides.)~
@74   = ~I am unfettered,
Freed from isolation
Freed from bondage.

I am whole
Healed from loneliness
Healed of separation.~
@75   = ~(By this moment, Tashia is pressing her lips firmly onto your own, her soft and pliant body pressed up next to yours. When she pulls away, you see that her cheeks are blushing bright red.)~
@76   = ~(A breeze swirls amidst the two of you, and a soft tinkling of bells rings within your hearing, meant for you alone, as she whispers) Thank you Hanali Celanil...~
@77   = ~(You wake up in the wee hours of the day, just before the sun has crested the horizon, allowing its warm rays to caress the earth in anticipation of a new day. You find Tashia curled near you, her body allowing yours to shield hers, and she mumbles) Just a few more minutes...~
@78   = ~(Giving a quick glance over the rest of the campsite, you see that the other members of your party are enjoying their own rest from the drudgeries of the previous night. Tashia shifts near you again, and she mumbles a little more) Love... you...~
@79   = ~(Continue to lie by Tashia's side, wrapping an arm protectively around her side, feeling the chill on her back slowly warming up as you press in close to her. She shivers initially, her breath quickening momentarily, and then her body presses close into yours as a result, and you hear a soft, satisfied sigh escape from her lips.)~
@80   = ~(Deciding to wake up your beloved with a sweet surprise, you envelop her body from behind, sliding your left arm along Tashia's, stroking her skin in soothing circles, while you gently nibble the tip of her fine, angular ear. There is a shift in Tashia's form as she pushes deeper into you, and you hear a small rumble build up in the back of her throat.)~
@81   = ~(Tashia continues to rest easily next to you, but then you feel her body tense as she shifts position, and you find yourself staring into her crystalline jade eyes, a small smile quirking her lips, and she whispers) Hmm... I could get used to this...~
@82   = ~(She leans forward, kissing you gently on your cheek, and then proceeds to sit up, pulling the blanket across her lean shoulders. Grasping your hand in hers, she barely stifles a yawn, and says) So what now?~
@83   = ~(Clasp her hand in yours) Would you mind... watching the sunrise with me?~
@84   = ~(sigh) This is pleasant, but we really should get going. The day won't get shorter just by lazing about.~
@85   = ~(Tashia's features soften, and her smile brightens) Of course I will...~
@86   = ~(Clasping her hand in yours, she leans in so close to you that your nose is slightly tickled by her hair, though it smells faintly of peach, as well as the leaves of the forest. As her hand holds yours, you feel the faint pulse of her heart through your grasping hands, but as she leans back and lays the back of her head on your shoulder, you feel her pulse quicken, until it matches your own, and it seems as if you both are sharing the same heartbeat, and your breathing synchronizes, sharing the same moment as one.)~
@87   = ~(The sun slowly climbs over the distance, and in this instant, as the rays slowly warm the both of you, Tashia slowly stands. Extending her hand to you, beckoning for you to stand with her. As you do so, she stands on her tip toes, and her soft lips press against yours once more, her arms drawing you in close. After a few breathless moments, she parts from you, a gasp escaping her lungs.)~
@88   = ~(Her eyes stare adoringly at you as she says) I could get used to this...~
@89   = ~(A look of disappointment crosses Tashia's face, and when she next speaks, you catch anger in her voice) You woke me up just to tell me to get going?~
@90   = ~(Her eyes dart across the other resting forms of the party, as she growls) You might want to make sure that everyone else is up before you wake me up.~
@91   = ~(Tashia rises and starts to roll up her bedroll as she grumbles about taking her foot and giving someone a solid kick in the ass the next time they wake her up early.)~
@92   = ~(A moan escapes from the back of Tashia's throat, and she shifts once more, this time lying on her side. Her hand rises up to caress your face, and her face rises to meet yours, caressing your lips with hers. Then softly under her breath, she whispers) Oh, Arilistan...~
@93   = ~(As she says his name, her eyes quickly open, and she falls away from you, her eyes now wide open, her hand falling from your cheek, covering her mouth, as she says) Oh <CHARNAME>... I'm... I didn't mean... I mean, I'm...~
@94   = ~(Tashia's face turns bright red, as she turns her head, and you see a tear roll down her cheek, and she doesn't raise her face to look at you.)~
@95   = ~(Anger rises deep within you, and your face contorts into a grimace) Arilistan? Even now, after all we've been through, you still want him, is that it? I shouldn't be surprised, even after all I did for you... the minute he showed up, you went rushing off into his arms, not even giving me a never-you-mind. Was that it, maybe? You still have feelings for Arilistan, but after he played you false, you decided to settle... for me?~
@96   = ~(Sorrow travels through your body, and you sit down, placing your head between your hands, as you quietly ask her) Tashia, you know I love you, and I understand that you would still have some feelings for Arilistan... I guess I want to know... when you said you loved me, were you telling the truth? I mean, you were in a bad state when we helped you, maybe it was relief you felt, not love...~
@97   = ~(Tashia's eyes go shiny for a moment, as she walks forward, taking your hands in hers, and she gives a soft kiss on your lips) <CHARNAME>, I wouldn't play with your feelings that way.~
@98   = ~(Her eyes downcast for just a second, she looks back into your face, softness and caring suffusing her countenance) I'm sorry this happened, but you are the only one for me. If I had any doubts as to your true feelings about me, they were quelled when you resurrected me.~
@99   = ~(She smiles tenderly, leaning into your hand, as she says) It is still new to me, so forgive me if I stumble a bit. But I know what I feel, and that is that I love you...~
@100  = ~(Tashia's eyes flash angrily at your allegations, and she hisses) It's not like that at all. Damn it, I didn't mean to say that at all... but if you can't believe that it was just a slip of the tongue, maybe you aren't the man I thought you were...~
@101  = ~(Tashia's face hardens) I didn't mean to hurt you, but you know what he was to me, what he meant to me. I'm sorry, part of that slipped through.~
@102  = ~(Tashia seems to be on the verge of tears as this last comes tumbling out of her mouth, but she stands resolute) But if you can't forgive me...~
@103  = ~(You quell your inner turmoil, and you look Tashia deep in her hesitant jade green eyes, and you tell her with no uncertainty) Of course I forgive you. I love you, I just needed to be certain...~
@104  = ~(You shake your head, your wound still raw from her inadvertent betrayal) I would never have done that to you Tashia. It's obvious to me that you aren't ready for another relationship... Maybe the next time you say you 'love' someone, you might wish to make sure that is the case.~
@105  = ~(Tashia's face contorts with fury, and she says) You bastard, you think that I was just lying about my emotions?~
@106  = ~(The anger then drains from her, as she says) If you can't even forgive one mistake, then it's probably just as well we split up.~
@107  = ~(She looks at you sadly, then turns around to pack away her bedroll, ignoring any further entreaties to speak.)~
@108  = ~(Tashia gives a great yawn, and she cocks her head) I'm getting tired of cold rations.  Would you be up for another riddle contest? This time, the winner would be the one to make dinner. A hot dinner too...~
@109  = ~Why don't you give the riddles a rest for the moment, Tashia? Besides, cold rations aren't all that bad. But I promise we will get something hot the next inn we come to.~
@110  = ~Sure, that doesn't sound like too bad an idea. Okay, lay your riddle on me.~
@111  = ~Hmmm... a riddle contest sounds good. But let's raise the stakes from just making dinner to something a bit higher.~
@112  = ~(Tashia frowns slightly, and says) Fine, have it your way.~
@113  = ~(Her voice drops to a low grumble) I mean, the damn biscuits are hard enough to hammer nails. And I'm getting tired of cutting off the green portion of the salted pork.~
@114  = ~(Tashia smiles, and closes her eyes) 
At the sound of me, men may dream 
Or stamp their feet 
At the sound of me, women may laugh 
Or sometimes weep. What am I?~
@115  = ~A story.~
@116  = ~Victory.~
@117  = ~Music.~
@118  = ~A story? Well, that is close. After all, stories may bring several emotions to bear on one's heart, whether a well-written love story to wonderful tales of bravery to chortles of mirth. And they certainly may inspire one to dream, but stomp one's feet? No, the answer you seek is music. But as I said, that was a very good try.~
@119  = ~(Tashia smiles, as she says) Looks like you get to make dinner tonight... I look forward to it.~
@120  = ~(Tashia harrumphs) So that is the way it is going to be, then?~
@121  = ~(Her smile grows larger, as she adds) Well, I will keep you to that promise, then. I do suggest that you keep some extra coin in your purse.~
@122  = ~(Tashia tentatively grabs a roll, and then smiles) Hey, this is really good.~
@123  = ~(She grabs another one and another one, adding) I'll be honest, I don't normally care for sausage. But this is fairly good...~
@124  = ~(Tashia stands on tiptoe, and lays a kiss on the side of your cheek) A girl could get accustomed to this...~
@125  = ~That is a rather good guess. I will be honest, I was thinking of 'Music' but I can see where victory may inspire dreams. And of course, women may laugh or cry, or both. Upon achieving victory, their emotions finally getting release. And when winning, I imagine one would raise a clamor, especially if a soldier, and stomping one's foot could do it.~
@126  = ~Wow, you must have heard this one before, music it is. Well, you just go attend to other matters, I shall get supper ready soon enough.~
@127  = ~(She heads off, talking quietly to herself) Hmm... he's getting better at this. I'm really going to have to think of a tougher one.~
@128  = ~(Tashia quickly makes a few snare traps, and goes about looking at the foliage around the location of camp, and she brightens perceptibly as she finds evidence of wild mint and sage. There is sound that comes from the direction of her simple snare, and she brings back two rabbits. She lays them down as she disrupts her other snare traps and then comes back to skin the rabbits.)~
@129  = ~(As the rabbits are roasting on a wooden stick over a fire, you see her taking a traveling tin full of water, mixing in the plants she found and ground up and putting a glaze over the rabbits.)~
@130  = ~(As she finishes, Tashia looks at you expectantly) How is it?~
@131  = ~This is actually pretty good, especially the rabbit. Heh, and while I'm not to fond of gruel, the honey really makes it enjoyable to eat. Better than I can do at any rate.~
@132  = ~Well, if this is the best you can do, I think it's a guarantee you won't be cooking for the party anymore. I would heartily recommend that you stay away from any kitchen you might be near.~
@133  = ~(Tashia blushes shyly) Thanks, I'm glad you like it. I know that I didn't really have a lot of choice or time. Heh, even back at home, I was usually the last one asked to cook. My step-mother would swear that I could burn water.~
@134  = ~(She reaches up, and kisses you on the lips, a slight dab of honey still on her lips and her fingers entwine your hair. When she lets go, she has a mischievous glint in her eyes) Sweets for the sweet, eh?~
@135  = ~(Tashia glares) I would like to see you do better than this. Oh wait, you didn't. I guess that will show me for trying to make a friendly wager with you.~
@136  = ~(She flounces away, growling to herself) I swear, sometimes I don't know why I bother.~
@137  = ~(Tashia, arches an eyebrow, her interest aroused) Okay, and what stakes are you wanting to wager?~
@138  = ~On second thought, dinner sounds just fine. Bring on the riddle...~
@139  = ~How about a massage? All this traveling does give us plenty of kinks.~
@140  = ~Sex and plenty of it...~
@141  = ~(Tashia looks at you with disgust) You know, just when I think I get to know you, you pull something like this. If you are in such great need of female companionship, go hire yourself a two-bit whore... preferably one with boils.~
@142  = ~(Tashia smiles, and closes her eyes as she considers the offer, and then opens them again) Okay, it's a deal.~
@143  = ~When set loose I fly away
Never so curse
As when I go astray
What am I?~
@144  = ~An arrow?~
@145  = ~A tongue?~
@146  = ~Hope?~
@147  = ~An arrow... close, but the only way it would be a curse for going astray is if you happened to hit someone by accident. The answer was 'Tongue'.~
@148  = ~(Tashia stretches her arms out, and then turns with her back to you, and she sighs contentedly as you put your hands to her soft flesh...~
@149  = ~You're really getting much better at this, aren't you? Well, turn around... a bet is a bet, after all.~
@150  = ~(As you follow her instructions, you feel her soft, but firm hands work on the muscles around your neck, gently kneading one moment then pressing firmly another moment. Then you feel a small moment of heat prickle your body, your muscles tensing suddenly, then going lax.)~
@151  = ~(As she leans in close, you feel two more presses on your back, and then find Tashia hugging you close from behind, the scent of her lilac hair filling your nostrils. Her hand starts to trace a design on your back) Feeling better?~
@152  = ~(Tashia looks at you with an odd look in her eyes) Hope? That is an odd turn of thought. I guess I can see what you are talking about, for to lose hope. And yet, without hope one might as well turn over and die. Well, the answer I was looking for was 'Tongue' actually.~
@153  = ~(She looks speculatively at you, and coming to a decision, she adds) I think that I will take a rain check on that back rub...~
@154  = ~(Tashia hums a nameless tune, a smile on her lips, and when she comes close, she deliberately bumps into you. Her smile widens as she gives your buttocks a tight squeeze before encircling you in a tight hug, the fingers of her left hand tracing a circular pattern in the small of your back.)~
@155  = ~Hmm... my mother warned me about men like you.~
@156  = ~(Her eyes sparkle as she reaches up, pressing her lips closely to yours, then withdraws.)~
@157  = ~Seriously, I think my foster parents would like you. Heh, even though they might have a thing or two to say about your table manners.~
@158  = ~Well, it's obvious that you must not think too highly of your foster parents. I mean, it is a long way from the Ten Towns, now isn't it? In fact, didn't you say that you and all your foster siblings left? Just where are they? Oh, and maybe it hasn't occurred to you by now, but I am getting tired of hearing your incessant banter. This gabble about your parents is just the longest string. Here is something to consider: silence is golden.~
@159  = ~What do you mean my table manners? I mean, how else are you supposed to let the chef know that you enjoy his cooking, other than by belching out loud and strong. Besides, how was I supposed to know that you weren't supposed to blow your nose on the tablecloth? How was I supposed to know that one doesn't sniff the pepper?~
@160  = ~Thanks Tashia, you really know how to cheer me up. You know, in all the time we've been together, you really haven't talked about your foster parents before now. What were they like? That is, if you don't mind telling me. I mean, they were an important part of your life, and if we get a chance to meet them... I wouldn't like to be an embarrassment to you.~
@161  = ~(Tashia's eyes snap open, and she angrily retorts) What the hell brought that on?!?~
@162  = ~(Letting go of your hands, Tashia curls up her fists, and in that moment, you see the collected energy of her wrath directing magic into her hands) You know what? Forget it, I don't really care what brought that on.~
@163  = ~(Tashia uncurls her fists, and the energy bleeds off into the environment) I guess I was a fool to fall for you. If all you wanted was someone to sit there and look pretty, I'm sure you could have bought any number of whores with all the gold you've spent up to now.~
@164  = ~(She snarls, and heads in the opposite direction of the party) I hope you enjoy being an utter bastard.~
@165  = ~(Tashia laughs in your arms, and as you get closer, you see Tashia wipe a small tear from the corner of her eye) Thank you... you know how long it's been since I last laughed like that?~
@166  = ~(She then looks deep into your eyes, and she says) Of course, you will have to get a bit more practice I think.~
@167  = ~(Drawing your body close, she drapes her arms over your shoulders, lowering your hand to her hip, and her smile becomes more intimate) Heh, it is a bit funny, though. When I am with you, my thoughts do occasionally turn to thoughts of family...~
@168  = ~Family? But, I thought you wanted to travel, didn't you? I mean, that's why you are in Amn, rather than in Ten Towns, right?~
@169  = ~Children? Do you honestly see us having children now? ...I'm sorry, that probably came out sounding harsher than I intended. It's just that having a family is a big step, and I think that we really need to discuss it further before we make a decision that will irrevocably change our lives. Please don't be angry.~
@170  = ~Family? Don't make me laugh. If it's family you want, then maybe it's just best that we stop this here and now. What would I do with a mewling brat? In case you haven't noticed, our lifestyle isn't very conducive to raising children, and I am not the type to settle down, especially to raise a bunch of rugrats.~
@171  = ~(Tashia's eyes grow shiny, and she smiles) Of course I want to travel, silly... we've just barely begun exploring the length and breadth of Faerun.~
@172  = ~(She gives a sigh, wrapping her arm into yours) After all, I left home to try and make my way along, didn't I? But I must admit, sometimes I get the urge of just finding a place to sit down, to rest, even if just a little.~
@173  = ~(Tashia smiles, and then adds) Heh, if it is with you, settling down wouldn't be all that bad.~
@174  = ~(Tashia grabs a hold of both your hands, holding them before her) Angry? Why would I be angry?~
@175  = ~(A wan smile crosses her face) Listen, <CHARNAME>, you are utterly correct that children are a large step. And who knows where tomorrow will take us...~
@176  = ~(She smiles, shyly, as she adds) But the fact that you were concerned about my reaction does mean a lot to me.~
@177  = ~(She kisses the back of your hand) Don't worry... we can wear down some of your rougher mannerisms.~
@178  = ~(Tashia stamps her foot on the ground, and she growls) Very well, you don't have to worry about me making you laugh.~
@179  = ~(She turns away, looking toward the horizon, before focusing her attention onto you) You know, I wasn't saying that we should just stop what we are doing, and start making babies as if there was no tomorrow. I guess that teaches me for sharing some of my innermost thoughts with you.~
@180  = ~(Tashia cocks her head, as she adds) Here is something you may want to consider: before you open your damn mouth, carefully consider your words. Especially if you profess love for someone. Because, after your last statement, I don't know if you are the person I thought you were... and frankly, I don't intend to find out.~
@181  = ~(Tashia's smile grows large, and she says) Well, we really haven't been together that long. But I wouldn't mind telling you about them...~
@182  = ~(She gives a sultry laugh) Well, my foster mother Abigail, she is a kind woman. Very industrious, in fact. Heck, sometimes I still wonder how she manages to get everything done. She has a predilection for cats. I mean, she has a whole shelf devoted to small cat figurines. She calls it her silly little hobby, but I remember one birthday when all of us managed to buy her a ceramic kitten. We accidentally dropped it, breaking its ear... but you would have thought we gave her the greatest treasure in the world. There was always something over the firepot, I don't recall any of us going to bed hungry. Even if we were grounded, she usually snuck something to us.~
@183  = ~Roald, he was our stepfather. Heh, he was fun to be around, too much so in fact. If it wasn't for Abigail, I think he would have let the farm detioriate. I don't mean that in a bad way, he was always a dreamer. All the stories he told... I think he always wanted to be an adventurer, but he settled for being a farmer. He always seemed to have time for us.~
@184  = ~(Tashia seems hesitant, as she says) Seems kind of boring... now that I put it that way, doesn't it?~
@185  = ~Not at all. They took in several orphaned children, and from the sounds of it they gave you a happy childhood. I would have been proud to call them parents, much as you do. Heh, you want dull, though, then you should have met Gorion. I mean, I guess it wasn't exactly his fault. How many scholars have a clue on how to raise a child, let alone in an isolated place like Candlekeep. Still, I miss him, even now.~
@186  = ~Tashia, what do you expect me to say? You won't hear me say anything insulting about your parents. I fell in love with the woman they raised, didn't I? Besides, whatever else we may think of our parents... we do love them, don't we? So, when all this is done, would you like to see your parents again?~
@187  = ~I am sorry, for asking you about your parents. I'm sorry, that came out wrong. It's just... listening to you speak, it reminded me of Gorion, and how I failed him. I didn't mean to bring down your mood...~
@188  = ~(Tashia kisses your cheek, tasting the salt of your tear) Yes, I know.~
@189  = ~(She pulls your hand towards the outer edge of the party) Come, Why don't you tell me a bit more?~
@190  = ~(Laying her head on your shoulder, she whispers) In a sense, he won't be gone, if those who loved him continue to remember him fondly.~
@191  = ~(Tashia links her fingers in yours and says) However, if something ever happens to you... well, if something happens, then I will never speak with you again.~
@192  = ~(You feel her hand pull you in close, a slight trembling to it, as she whispers) You... you mean that, don't you?~
@193  = ~(Tashia's face beams with pleasure, and she grabs your face with both hands, and gives a deep kiss that takes your breath away.)~
@194  = ~(When she breaks apart, her eyes twinkle, and she says) I'm sorry, it's just... well, Arilistan never even asked me about my family, let alone my parents. And here, you offer...~
@195  = ~(She smiles, as she says) Of course, I will go. You know how long it has been since I last saw them?~
@196  = ~(Wrapping her arms tightly around you, you feel the rise and fall of her breath, as her chest presses in close) Funny, I was so eager to leave. And yet, I sometimes miss the old place. Weird, isn't it?~
@197  = ~(Tashia holds your hands briefly, and she says) I understand.~
@198  = ~(She gives a wry chuckle) You don't have to apologize for everything though. I can imagine just how you feel about Gorion, and I am not surprised that you still wish to be alone.~
@199  = ~(Tashia leans in, and gives a slight kiss on our cheek, then pulling apart) However, you aren't alone in this. Remember that. If you wish to talk, I am here...~
@200  = ~(You notice that Tashia is momentarily preoccupied, and you hear her utter in a soft tranquil, voice) Snookums? Pookie? Sweatheart? Darling? Hmm...~
@201  = ~Tashia, get your ass in gear. We don't have time for your idle musings. It puts us all in danger.~
@202  = ~What's that, Tashia?~
@203  = ~(A look of embarrassment and irritation crosses Tashia's face, and as she quickly takes her place with the rest of the party, she says) Well, excuse me. The next time I will be sure to ask for your permission. Sheesh...~
@204  = ~(Her jade green eyes open slightly, and her face turns a slight pink of embarrassment, but a grin spreads across her face) Oh, it's nothing really. I was just thinking of what kinda endearment you would like. For some reason, though, I don't think sugarpie would fit you.~
@205  = ~(A devilish light dances in her eyes, and her smile softens as she adds) But what do you think of... darling?~
@206  = ~You can call me whatever you want, just so long as you don't call me late to supper...~
@207  = ~Darling. I would like that... love.~
@208  = ~Do we really have time for this?~
@209  = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide, and she playfully punches you in the shoulder, giggling) That was awful. That one was old in Myth Drannor.~
@210  = ~(Cupping your face in her hands, she gives you a passionate kiss, and her eyes seem to twinkle) But it's good to see you smile. You should do it more often.~
@211  = ~(Tashia walks forward, and then stops as you walk ahead of her. When you turn your head, you see her eyeing your form appreciatively, licking her lips, and says) Maybe I should just call you honey-buns...~
@212  = ~(Leaning up to kiss you on the cheek, her fingers interlocking tightly with yours, Tashia says) Don't worry, it gets easier to say. All you need is practice, darling...~
@213  = ~(She giggles) So, there better not be any slacking off...~
@214  = ~(Tashia looks at you sadly, shaking her head as she walks away) I guess you kinda hand-picked bastard for yourself today, haven't you?~
@215  = ~(As you don the belt, you feel a pressure grow on your chest, and a thickening in your hips. Glancing down, you see that you have suddenly grown a pair of breasts, and when you swivel to look at the rest of your body, the motion slightly causes you to sway, interfering with your sense of balance as your mind must grapple with the definite change you just underwent.)~
@216  = ~Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events... (Tashia smiles her right hand creeping along the edge of your arm, gently rubbing your skin, while her left hand rests gently on the swell of your hip.)~
@217  = ~(Your ear tickles as Tashia's hair brushes alongside it) Hmm... truth be known, I never expected this to happen, but until we get you cured, I suppose we'll have to make the best of a bad situation.~
@218  = ~(Tashia's left hand traces along the curve of your body, and then is softly cupping your breast as she whispers, her breathing getting a bit heavy) Definitely will have to get you a bodice. Maybe a brace would be better, that would give a bit more support without being as constricting.~
@219  = ~(Then Tashia pulls away, a slightly scandalized look on her face) Umm, I'm sorry, I mean...~
@220  = ~(As Tashia continues to touch and caress your body, you feel disgust rising in you, and turn around, slapping her hand away from your body, and pushing her away) Damn it, Tashia. Just what in the hell are you doing? Are you actually getting aroused by this?!? Let's just say that I am having second thoughts about you, about us.~
@221  = ~(Step away, putting a foot of distance between you and her) I'm sorry. This is very confusing to me. I mean, you being a woman, and now I... I know I'm making a hash of explaining. I think it would be best to wait until we find a way to cure me. That doesn't mean I don't love you, because I do, but in this case, a little patience might be best.~
@222  = ~(Clasp Tashia's hand, and pull her toward you, and eagerly kiss her on the lips) Tashia, there is nothing to apologize for. I can't say that I expected this either, but that doesn't mean it has to be a complete waste.~
@223  = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide, and a look of pity crosses her face) You are a large hypocrite aren't you?~
@224  = ~(Her pity slowly gives way to anger, and she grabs your shirt by the collar, twisting in her hand) Maybe it hasn't occurred to you, you son of a bitch, but maybe, just maybe, what woman in her right mind would stay together with a man who's alternate form is that of the Slayer.~
@225  = ~(She pushes back with all her strength, causing you to stumble briefly) Maybe that's different in your mind, but let me tell you <CHARNAME>, no woman in her right mind would fall for you unless she was already in love with you.~
@226  = ~(Tashia shakes her head sadly as she moves away) I guess that old saying is true. There's no sin in loving men, only pain...~
@227  = ~(Tashia smiles, and she holds your hand tightly in hers) I understand what you are saying, <CHARNAME>. Don't think anything further of it.~
@228  = ~(She raises your hand to her lips, and kisses it tenderly before letting it go) I'll be honest. I didn't think that I would even have considered, well, you know...~
@229  = ~(By Tashia's gestures you quickly ascertain she meant bedding you, but she adds) But, when I saw you that way, even if I was a bit uncertain about what to do, the one thing I knew for certain was that I loved you.~
@230  = ~(She sighs, and gives a slight smile, just holding your hand now) Heh, I guess I didn't know how to reassure you, and I'm sorry you became confused.~
@231  = ~(Tashia smiles gently) But we will find a way to remove this curse, I promise. Then, you should be as good as new.~
@232  = ~(Tashia stops, cocking her head, and then cryptically says) I hope we can before a month passes...~
@233  = ~(Tashia arches her back under your touch, and a moan escapes her lips. She leans into you, and as her back makes contact with your bosom, you feel a shiver ripple through her body.)~
@234  = ~(Tashia's breathing grows ragged as she turns to face you, her face flushed with passion and excitement, but a smile adorns her face as well.)~
@235  = ~(She runs her fingers up your chest) I wasn't sure... And besides, in my case it would be a mile in my stockings.~
@236  = ~(Tashia presses her lips to yours, gathering your fingers into hers, and slowly lowering them down over her backside.)~
@237  = ~(She briefly breaks apart, stroking the inside of your thigh, and whispers) Whatever form you take, whatever you look like, know that I do love you... (and then she reaches higher...)~
@238  = ~(Tashia looks around at the latest change in your surroundings, her head leaning from one side to another, trying to make sense of the surroundings) It seems like the designers of this place were just as insane as the inmates.~
@239  = ~(Shutting her eyes, she says) Gods, even with my eyes closed, my mind still wants to fill in all the parts that are missing, and remove the parts that are just wrong.~
@240  = ~(Tashia's eyes open again, and she gives one last look around before averting her gaze and straightening her robes) I seriously hope whoever designed this place was committed.~
@241  = ~(Raising her head once more, Tashia looks directly at you and complains) Ugh, this is going to be haunting my dreams tonight, that's for damn sure.~
@242  = ~(Lay a gentle hand on her shoulder) Tashia, do you have another riddle for me? To get out of here will require us to keep our wits sharp... and I've found your riddles a perfect whetstone for my mind.~
@243  = ~(Glance at Tashia in annoyance) Nobody forced you to come along, you know that. I swear, maybe I should have left you in Trademeet to drown your sorrows in ale. Here is a thought for you. Why don't you get some backbone, shut up, and learn to put up with it.~
@244  = ~(Take Tashia's hand in yours, look earnestly into her eyes) You're not the only one that feels out of place here. We'll get out of here as soon as possible, I promise.~
@245  = ~(Tashia's eyes widen in surprise, but her mouth contorts into a snarl) How dare you say that! You were the one who approached me! Hell, I told you to leave me alone.~
@246  = ~(Tashia's eyes narrow, her brow furrows, and from the corner of your own eyes you see that her left hand, curled into a fist, is starting to glow with a nimbus of yellow energy, the very air crackling with her growing fury.)~
@247  = ~(Then her fist opens, and Tashia's face looks drained as she simply says) You know what? You aren't worth it.~
@248  = ~(Tashia loses herself in your eyes momentarily, and then she pulls away, her fingers almost regretfully pulling away from yours. Bafflement and fear briefly appearing on Tashia's face) Yes, let's get out of here.~
@249  = ~(She pulls her hand away from yours, and mumbles) Everything is confused in this bedlam.~
@250  = ~(Tashia pulls away, looking deep into your eyes) I think there is a flaw in your logic somewhere, but given the nature of this place, it does make some kind of twisted sense.~
@251  = ~(Tashia takes a deep breath, closing her eyes as she searches her memory, and then she says)~
@252  = ~Though giving pleasure to many
I am more than a passing fancy
A bagatelle. I am looked down upon
by my peers for my sense of fun.

Jealous introverts, they think me flippant
Silver-tongued I may be, but not irreverent
I am all show, all style.
Here is the key, come inside: I'll make you smile.~
@253  = ~(Lean in close, and while Tashia's eyes are closed, kiss her sweetly on the lips) The answer is you, isn't it? Solving your riddles gives me joy. Your tongue, much like the rest of you, is a beauty to see and hear, and your joy of life lifts up my own spirits.~
@254  = ~(Lean in close, feeling the warm air as Tashia breathes in and out) Is the answer... riddle? Between the imagery as well as the innuendo, it couldn't be much else.~
@255  = ~(Think hard, then shake your head) I can't figure out the answer to the riddle. What is it?~
@256  = ~(Tashia briefly returns your kiss, you feel her lips part slightly, then her eyes pop wide open, and a blush suffuses her face, as she pushes you away) What are you doing... no, I'm not the answer.~
@257  = ~(She pulls back from you, a slightly puzzled look on her face) The answer was...~
@258  = ~(She stutters) Um, never mind.~
@259  = ~(Tashia leans into you, sharing your warmth, and she smiles, turning to look into your eyes) Heh, you figured out the answer.~
@260  = ~(You feel the shift of her shoulders against your body) That's all that came to mind, sad to say. This stupid place is still affecting me, I guess.~
@261  = ~(Tashia smirks, running her fingers through a few idle strands of your hair) So, why not apply your great wit and find the exit through here.~
@262  = ~(Tashia sighs, then a small smile creeps up on her face) Heh, maybe it wasn't one of my better riddles.~
@263  = ~(She drags a finger along your jaw line) And the answer is exactly what the question itself is... the answer is riddle.~
@264  = ~(Tashia then shrugs) A riddle that is its own answer if you will, the kind of test this place seems to rely on.~
@265  = ~(Your party starts to set up camp, when you notice Tashia going about her chores. She tries to stifle a yawn, but fails and she complains to herself) Great, just great. I'll be at this for several hours. I really could use an extra pair of hands.~
@266  = ~(Tashia then rises, hugging her arms to her chest) An extra pair of hands... well, why didn't I think of that earlier.~
@267  = ~(The second Tashia bends over to attend to her business, when she twists her head and gives a wink at you.)~
@268  = ~(As you stare at the magically created Tashia, you feel a hand slide around your waist, and she says mischievously) Like what you see?~
@269  = ~(Hug Tashia close to your side, and grin at her) Actually, this gives me an idea. You know how they say double the pleasure, double the fun? Well, wouldn't you say this is an opportunity too good to pass up?~
@270  = ~(Smile at her) Isn't that kinda cheating? I mean using your simulacrum to help with your chores?~
@271  = ~Pussyfoot? I thought that was that rare birth defect that required girls to wear open-toed sandals.~
@272  = ~(Let your face darken, and tell her) Tashia, I don't even like the suggestion you are making. I was just looking to see if you needed any help, but I see that you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to your business.~
@273  = ~(Tashia laughs at your reaction and she leans in and kisses you on the cheek) Oh, you don't need to be that way.~
@274  = ~(She shrugs, and quietly adds) It was a joke, nothing more.~
@275  = ~(Tashia gives your hand a gentle squeeze) You need to loosen up just a bit, but then again, that might be part of your charm.~
@276  = ~(Tashia laughs, holding tightly to your arm) I guess it is cheating in a way.~
@277  = ~(Then she cups your face with her hands, and after giving a long, soft kiss, she whispers) On the other hand, this does give us more time for ourselves.~
@278  = ~Tashia slowly pulls you away from the others, while in the distance you can hear her simulacrum tidying up...~
@279  = ~(Tashia's eyes widen with surprise) Let me get this straight. You are talking about you and me... and me, together at night?~
@280  = ~(She closes her eyes, a 'hmm' escaping her lips) Let me ask this question of you, then: if I can make a simulacrum of myself, then there is no reason I couldn't duplicate you. Tell me, how would you like being just one of a pair when we got... intimate?~
@281  = ~Well, now that you put it that way, I guess fair is fair. Sure, if that's what you want, I'm willing to give it a whirl.~
@282  = ~Well, now that you put it that way, I guess I didn't think that far ahead. I wouldn't like that idea one bit. It would be like someone pretending to be me, but wasn't.~
@283  = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide, surprised momentarily claiming her face, but then she smiles) I will keep you to your promise then.~
@284  = ~(Tashia stands on her tiptoes, kissing you on the ear, running her hands along the small of your back, when you feel another pair of hands slowly massaging your stomach, striving lower, and she whispers) I guess the old saying is true... two heads are better than one.~
@285  = ~(Tashia nods her head) That was my feeling exactly.~
@286  = ~(Her face softens slightly, and she gives a furtive kiss on the side of your cheek) But I won't deny it was nice to see that you still found me attractive.~
@287  = ~Just be glad that you were caught staring at my... reflection, and not some other woman. I would really hate to have to hold your head in a bucket of ice cold water until you stopped kicking.~
@288  = ~(Tashia's face is immobilized with shock at what you said, and then she starts to giggle.)~
@289  = ~<CHARNAME>, that was awful.~
@290  = ~(As the last of her giggles stops, she says) Nice try side-stepping my question, but you won't get off the hook that easy. Now, honestly, how would you like it if I did the exact same to you?~
@291  = ~(Grin at her) Well, this may be spur of the moment, but I would be willing to try anything once.~
@292  = ~(Shrug) I guess you're right. Besides, I like the original best...~
@293  = ~(You feel a pair of arms slide around your waist, and Tashia pulls you close. She murmurs contentedly for a few minutes, laying her head against the small of your back.)~
@294  = ~(She whispers) You don't feel any different to me. Then again, it isn't everyday someone loses their soul.~
@295  = ~(She gently moves around until she is standing in front of you. She cups your cheek with a dainty hand) We will beat Irenicus, my love, and restore you, I promise. Maybe then, we can even find a way to get rid of the taint.~
@296  = ~Irenicus may have my soul, but you have my heart... guess which is more important to me.~
@297  = ~Do you honestly think we can remove my taint? Look what happened after Irenicus took it.~
@298  = ~Aren't you afraid of me? Sometimes it feels like I can barely control the Slayer. You would be safer away from me.~
@299  = ~Once I reclaim my birthright, nothing shall ever take it from me again.~
@300  = ~You shouldn't let such thoughts weigh you down. Maybe there is something we can do to let you forget such concerns, if only for a little while.~
@301  = ~(Tashia shakes her head gently, and says) If you were thinking of another riddle, maybe we can do that some other time. I appreciate your attempts to take my mind off the matter, but I'm afraid it won't work this time.~
@302  = ~(She kisses the back of your knuckles) But I will try not to speak of it again. You already have enough worries without me adding to them. Just remember, I will always be here for you.~
@303  = ~(Tashia smiles shyly, and squeezes your hand) That's just like you, isn't it? You're still more worried about me than yourself.~
@304  = ~(She stands on her toes, and kisses you on the nose) Is it so hard to believe that I feel the same way about you?~
@305  = ~I sometimes wonder. After all, don't you get scared of the Slayer?~
@306  = ~I would feel better about it if we could remove Bhaal's corruption entirely~
@307  = ~I never had many people in my life who felt that way about me.~
@308  = ~As much as I would like to stay here, we must continue onward.~
@309  = ~(Tashia's eyes widen slightly, and there is a bit of moisture in the corner of her eye which she wipes away) I'm sorry to hear that. However, I promise that I shall always remain by your side.~
@310  = ~(She chuckles slightly) You can't get rid of me that easily.~
@311  = ~(Tashia nods) Yes, let's continue, and bring this to an end.~
@312  = ~(Tashia quietly stares into the distance, then says) I...don't know if we can remove the taint. It should be possible. Irenicus did it after all. And yet, that wasn't the only thing he took. Somehow he also took your soul with it.~
@313  = ~If we get back what is mine, I won't allow another person to torture me in such a way.~
@314  = ~And if you could remove the taint, what would you do with it?~
@315  = ~And left me with the Slayer.~
@316  = ~This is idle speculation. Until we defeat Irenicus, we should continue.~
@317  = ~(Tashia leans supportively into your side, and breathes softly on the back of your neck) And I will do all in my power to keep you from being hurt again.~
@318  = ~(She whispers) Physical strength is measured by what we can carry; spiritual by what we can bear. I don't know if I could carry the burden you carry alone. But together? I will help you shoulder it.~
@319  = ~(Tashia's brow furrows) I don't know. I guess I haven't given that any thought.~
@320  = ~(She shudders) And who knows, if separated, it could easily bond to anything else.~
@321  = ~(Tashia shrugs) It could cause even more trouble than ever.~
@322  = ~(Tashia nods) All too true. If...no, not if, when we beat Irenicus, maybe it would be for the best to leave everything alone.~
@323  = ~(She grimaces) Who knows what another attempt might do to you.~
@324  = ~(Tashia stands silent for a few seconds, then hesitantly says) Yes, <CHARNAME>, sometimes you scare me. Not when we are together like this, but when you lose control of yourself--like you did with the Slayer...~
@325  = ~I wouldn't knowingly hurt you, Tashia. Not now, not ever.~
@326  = ~Maybe you are attracted to that which endangers you.~
@327  = ~If you are so scared of me, we should split up until you are sure you want to be with me.~
@328  = ~Don't you think I would have removed Bhaal's touch if I could?~
@329  = ~(Tashia embraces you again, and whispers) I know you wouldn't, at least when you are yourself. It's the unknowns I fear, though.~
@330  = ~(She trembles slightly) But I can't let my fear rule me. You are... you, not Arilistan.~
@331  = ~(Tashia's mouth opens, then shuts as she withholds what she was going to say.)~
@332  = ~(She growls) <CHARNAME>, that isn't even funny. I would ask you not to make another statement, even in jest, like that again.~
@333  = ~(Tashia's face frowns, but you don't see her disagreeing with you.)~
@334  = ~(She says hesitantly) Maybe... maybe you are right. It isn't fair to you if I fear being held in your arms.~
@335  = ~(Tashia pulls away slightly, concern filling her voice) Birthright? Did I hear you right? Since when does such a corrupt 'inheritance' count as a birthright?~
@336  = ~If I could rid myself of this 'birthright,' I would.~
@337  = ~Yes, it is a birthright, but one that can be as much of a curse, as a blessing.~
@338  = ~Yes, once I reclaim what is mine, nothing shall ever stand in my way.~
@339  = ~(Tashia mulls over your words, then gives a slight nod) Our parents leave their marks on us, don't they?~
@340  = ~(She looks distantly away) But it is also up to us how much of our lives they touch.~
@341  = ~(Tashia pulls away, barely controlling a look of fright on her face) That...that is how Arilistan sounded just before he went bad.~
@342  = ~(She shakes her head) I...I can't go through that again. I'm sorry <CHARNAME>...I have to go.~
@343  = ~(When Tashia pulls back, she gently says) No wonder you are so flexible. You seem so at peace with yourself. It almost makes me wonder why you stay with me.~
@344  = ~(Tashia chuckles) After all, I thought all monks were ascetics, living lives of deprivation off in some desert...~
@345  = ~(Pull Tashia towards you, caress her lips with yours, and then say) That is the typical impression of what we are, sad to say. But there are many schools, many forms. One of the primary tenets of my school is balance. One mind, one body, two become one...~
@346  = ~(Smile gently at Tashia, holding her hand tightly in yours, and say) There are many schools, love. Not all of us are ascetics, eschewing the simplest of human contact. Enlightenment is the destination, but the journey is a whole lifetime...~
@347  = ~That is just the physical portion of my training. No different than a warrior who goes through his paces, or even a mage when he studies his spellbook. Your riddles are just as good as many of the koans I was forced to ponder. So, would you like to help me train by giving me one?~
@348  = ~(Look at Tashia, irritation crossing your face) You don't know what is entailed in my training, do you? I guess the masters were right, that I have to rid myself of all distractions. I think, no, I know it is best that we separate...~
@349  = ~(Tashia's eyes open, and she whispers) I felt that... I mean...~
@350  = ~I don't know how to explain how I feel. Have you ever been in a steam house, until your very body was tingling with warmth, and then you rush out into the fresh snow, allowing the chill to shock your system. It takes your breath away, and at the same time you feel... alive.~
@351  = ~(Smile, reaching forward to Tashia, allowing her to feel the pulse of your heart once more, the very scarlet coil of your life, as it matches Tashia's) The feeling is different for everyone, but when they hit the crescendo, it is always an exultation of life... Would you care to learn more?~
@352  = ~(Smile at Tashia's progress, but you decide, much as a child must take small steps before taking larger ones, Tashia has done well with her first step, but she has had enough for now.) You've done well, but these matters take time. Let's go back to the others. (Lick her pointy ear) Man, or elf does need to eat, after all.~
@353  = ~(As Tashia continues to breath, all the worries leave her face again, and then press your lips to hers as she inhales. Hold firm next to her, and her entire being floods into you, reminding you of fresh earth, of the scent of the forest, of the cool cleansing of winter, as her life force mixes with yours. In that moment, your souls become bound as one for that moment in eternity...)~
@354  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she says) Oh, okay, let's get going.~
@355  = ~(She twines her hand in yours, and says) However, you better be careful of what you say. Some of the tales they tell of monks is the conservation of action. Yet, that just almost reminds me of my brother. He hated to clean. He asked 'Why bother to clean when it's just going to get dirty?'~
@356  = ~(She laughs) He ended up cleaning after himself when he woke up with chigger bites up and down his body.~
@357  = ~(Tashia looks quizzically at you, and she murmurs) Is this some kind of riddle? Heh, I guess I'm getting a taste of my own medicine.~
@358  = ~(She closes her eyes, her entire being becoming still, her breathing slows, and the tension and worry leaves her body, when she opens her eyes again, a smile tugging her face.)~
@359  = ~I think I see what you mean. By holding onto the past, to my regrets, my failures, whatever you want to call it, then I can hardly find contentment in my current state?~
@360  = ~(Then she giggles, and says) I'm sorry, that just didn't sound like me there...~
@361  = ~(Smile at Tashia, and laugh) No, that didn't sound like you, but then, can any of us honestly say that we know ourselves? Here, let me show you the first step to reaching that state again...~
@362  = ~(Smile at Tashia, and laugh) Well, there are depths that we seldom plumb. Why should you be any different? Hmmm... since I strive for balance, and gave you something to consider, would you care to reciprocate in kind?~
@363  = ~(Smile at Tashia, holding her close to you, and say) Well, I think that we're done for today. Shall we get back with the others?~
@364  = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide at this abrupt dismissal, but anger contorts her face, and she says) That's all I am? Some kind of distraction from your training?~
@365  = ~(Her eyes slowly glow with an unnatural glint, and she whispers) Spirituality: the last refuge of a failed life. Just another way of distracting yourself from what you are.~
@366  = ~(Tashia then turns on her heels, and moves to rejoin the others.)~
@367  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she says) That was gently said, but amusing. Very well, give me a moment to think.~
@368  = ~(Her eyes close, and she says) A lovely woman, a lady, safeguarded me to the utmost; at times she plied me with her fingers, and other times gave me to her lord and loyal master. Then he poked his head inside me, pushed it up until it fitted tightly. I, adorned, was bound to be filled with something rough if the loyal lord could keep it up. Guess what I mean...~
@369  = ~(Hold Tashia close to you, stroking along the length of her inner thigh, and admit) I can only think of one answer for it... (Grin, and nibble her ear) But I doubt that it would be that simple.~
@370  = ~(Hold Tashia close, and answer) Is it a helmet? Or a kirtle?~
@371  = ~(Hold Tashia close, and admit) I really have no idea what it is. What is the answer you have?~
@372  = ~(Tashia laughs, and touches the tip of your nose with her finger) Naughty, naughty...~
@373  = ~(She shakes her head, as her hands grasp delicately towards you) I think it is safe to say that your mind listens to your body, that is for sure.~
@374  = ~(Smirking, she says) The answer is... (and loses the solution as her soft, pliant mouth presses onto yours.)~
@375  = ~(Tashia's smile tells you that you are correct, and the languorous kisses she bestows tells you she is very pleased.)~
@376  = ~Heh, I guess that you will be teaching me a thing or two about riddlecraft before too much longer.~
@377  = ~(Tashia smiles, and she says) The answer was helmet, although I've heard kirtle as an alternate answer.~
@378  = ~(She smiles, kissing the tip of your nose, and says) Guess you have some more practice to go through as well...~
@379  = ~(Tashia walks over to you, and she runs her fingers lightly along your arm, her light touch daintily playing at the scars and muscular bulges.)~
@380  = ~(Her fingers then slowly trace patterns on the small of your back and you feel a soft fluttering on your arm shoulder as she gently kisses you. Then you feel a gentle squeeze as her arms encircle you, and Tashia hugs you from behind, resting her head between your shoulder blades.)~
@381  = ~Mmm... you are my rock, you know. In this world of change, in this time of chaos, you are my sole bastion.~
@382  = ~(You feel the wind pick up, and Tashia's long hair tenderly tickles your back.)~
@383  = ~(A small sigh escapes her lips, and she then whispers) Given any thought to your... or our future? I guess this has been bothering me, for I don't know if you will go back to your people, or stay in Amn or anything. Will you always be there for me?~
@384  = ~(Turn around, embrace Tashia tightly in your arms, and laugh) Of course I will always be there for you. You would have to kill me to pry myself away from you. Heh, I truly don't know what I intend to do after all this is over. I may decide to go back and find out more about my people. One thing I do know that is my blood is too restless to settle down for long...and I'll be honest, I like the challenges I face. It keeps me strong. Life is a test, and it is up to us to face it on our own terms. Of course, being strong means both mentally and physically. Perhaps you would like to help me flex my mind by telling me one of your riddles...~
@385  = ~Oh, I don't know what my future holds, other than that you are the most important part of it. Heh, you know, I never really felt comfortable in the confines of Candlekeep. I felt caged, trapped. I always took pride in my own abilities, my own strengths. In some ways, magic just seemed like a cheat, and an unreliable one at best. So imagine my surprise when I found that the most important person in my life is also the most magical...~
@386  = ~(Slide an arm around Tashia, and lean in to kiss her softly on the lips) Among my people, or so I was told, life was a continuous series of tests. So, I doubt that I will be going back there anytime soon. Oh it may be nice to visit there when and if this is done.But I much prefer not having to worry about some predator sneaking up on me as we dally.Would you care to live that way for the rest of your life? Having your very mettle tested?~
@387  = ~(Pull away from her) Tashia, you're smothering me. Have you thought that maybe, just maybe, I would not have had to rescue you if you had been stronger? There are many things I learned in Candlekeep, but one of the greatest was that civilization weakens people. It would be best to tear the whole thing apart, and let nature have its way. If you wish to remain by my side, you must learn to be strong as well.~
@388  = ~(Tashia laughs) I don't know that I would go so far as to assume that all of life is a test, but you are right that sometimes it is a struggle. How is that old saying go? That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.~
@389  = ~(She kisses your shoulder) Okay, here is a riddle I've been saving up especially for you:
I'm strong and pointed. Shuddering, I die,
a violent release. For my reputable master
I'll plunge below the plimsoll line,
well and truly engineer an opening.
A desperate man stands behind me and develops me
himself; he carries a cloth. Sometimes one helps
me out of a wet hot spot
sometimes he gets me into a fix and forces me.
Say what I am called...~
@390  = ~(Look guiltily down at your groin and give a crooked smile to Tashia.) he answer can't be what I am thinking it is, can it?~
@391  = ~This must be one of those riddles that might sound vulgar, but actually mean something quite mundane. I would guess the answer is a poker or a brand.~
@392  = ~You have me beat Tashia. What is the answer?~
@393  = ~(Tashia laughs, and you feel her lips kiss and nip at your skin) Hmm, guess you were reading my mind after all...~
@394  = ~(She grins) That is one thing I appreciate about you, you know. How straightforward you are...~
@395  = ~(Tashia slowly walks away, adding an extra wiggle to her walk) I find it refreshing. And in you, quite becoming.~
@396  = ~(Tashia then stops, pressing her fingers to her lips, blows you a kiss, and beckons you to follow her into the underbrush, away from the party.)~
@397  = ~(Tashia pouts, but you can tell there is amusement behind her reaction) Damn, I didn't think you would get a correct answer.~
@398  = ~(Tashia smiles, as she adds) Especially considering that I wasn't even thinking of that as an answer.~
@399  = ~(She moves forward, twining her hand into yours) And just what reward should I give the master of my riddles, and my heart...~
@400  = ~(Tashia pulls your hand to the swell of her bosom, and you feel her heart beat rapidly increase as she kisses you once more...)~
@401  = ~(Tashia laughs) Well, there were plenty of answers.~
@402  = ~(She gives a wink, as she says) Many would say a poker or firebrand would be an answer.~
@403  = ~Tashia's hand slowly caresses your buttocks) Although I was thinking of something else more... rigid...~
@404  = ~(Tashia smiles at your words, and she squeezes you tighter, her hands working their way down the length of your waste) That is sweet of you to say so.~
@405  = ~(She giggles, as her hands continue to dance along the edge of your body, and she adds) I must admit that I can understand the hesitance of magic.~
@406  = ~(Tashia turns silent, and she looks away) I mean, its one thing if someone, like the wizards, manipulate magic for themselves, or else it is bestowed by one's deity. But to have it I have my doubts as well about what I am. To have magic as your birthright... it can be scary.~
@407  = ~(She smiles, leans into you, and whispers) You are the most important person in my life as well...~
@408  = ~(Tashia quirks her lips) Oh, testing my metal?~
@409  = ~(She places a hand on your forehead, and she whispers) Such as having a will of iron? (She then nibbles at your ear, smiling at her play on words.)~
@410  = ~(Tashia then caresses the small of your back) Or nerves of steel? (as her dancing fingers send butterflies up through your body.)~
@411  = ~(She presses her taut body into yours, and you feel her heartbeat increase in contact with your skin, as she whispers) Possibly a heart of gold?~
@412  = ~(She kisses you passionately, and whispers) Just remember...  Heat shapes metal...~
@413  = ~(Tashia's eyes flare open, and you feel her fingernails dig into your skin. There is a slight burning at each point her nails pierce your skin, and that's when you realize that the warmth is emanating from Tashia.)~
@414  = ~(She growls) Strong enough for you? And just what do you mean by that?~
@415  = ~(The warmth flares into an exploding pain as she draws blood with her hands. Then blessed coolness fills your body, and you feel Tashia pull away from you.)~
@416  = ~(she blinks back tears in her anger, as she says) If you truly think that I'm so weak, then why the hell would you rescue me?~
@417  = ~(She spits once more on the ground) Well, here is something for you to consider, he of the sweaty jockstrap. It doesn't matter how strong you are, death claims all: weak and strong, young and old.~
@418  = ~(Tashia looks at you sadly, and then makes her way into the night...)~
@419  = ~(Tashia playfully comes up from behind you, the wind picking up her robes, and enshrouding your with their folds. As the loose garments hide you from the looks of the rest of the party, Tashia leans in further, the press of her breasts momentarily drawing your attention from Tashia's light kisses of the back of your neck. Her long blond hair tickles the back of your neck, and you notice the slight pressure on the back of your leg as Tashia raises her slight foot and caresses your leg through your garments.)~
@420  = ~(Tashia's head then rests on the back of your neck, and she murmurs) Who would have thought, after all that's happened in my life, the loss of my parents, the emergence of my powers, a betrayal, that I could still find happiness. With you, though, I have everything I could want.~
@421  = ~(Tashia chuckles, tickling your ribs) Except maybe for washboard abs...~
@422  = ~(She sighs contentedly, and whispers) And what do you want, my love?~
@423  = ~(laugh, and say) Why, whatever you want most in the world my love. Well, except maybe for washboard abs. I don't relish doing my laundry on your stomach.~
@424  = ~I want only for there to be no regrets between us, Tashia.~
@425  = ~(chuckle) I don't tend to do longterm thinking. eems to me that natural selection would see to it that adventurers who ask themselves 'What is my purpose in my life?' very quickly lacked both. For the moment, however, how about one of your riddles?~
@426  = ~(Clasp her hand in yours, and allow the magic to flow from within) I have a few ideas about that. You know, with our combined might, mostly nothing can stand in our way. Imagine the power we could grasp...~
@427  = ~(Tashia laughs in pleasure) I so do love a man with a sense of humor.~
@428  = ~(Tashia twists her head saucily, and she runs her hands along the small of your back, when a whimsical gleam crosses her eye.)~
@429  = ~(She suddenly leaps up, kissing you tight on the lips, and an electric flare fills your body as you windmill backwards, and fall on the ground, momentarily blacking out.)~
@430  = ~(As you get up from Tashia's electric kiss, she hungrily moves toward you, as she whispers) That is just the start, love...~
@431  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she leans in to kiss your neck, your chin, and finally your lips. Each kiss creates an electrical pulse that surges through your entire body until her lips meet yours, and a blue nimbus flares up around you, sending a fresh wave of pleasure through both of your bodies.)~
@432  = ~(She pulls your hand to the swell of her breast, and you feel the warmth of her skin slowly increase under your fingertips. You meet a slight resistance when she exhales, but this observation goes unnoticed as you feel the pulse of Tashia's very life in your hands...and you hear your dull thud in your own ears, matching hers beat per beat.)~
@433  = ~(She takes a hold of your other hand, and she starts to gently kiss the fingertips, slowly working her way along the palm, the wrist, and then the length of your arm, as she whispers) I love you...~
@434  = ~(Tashia moans, and you feel her power rise up to match yours. Hers is cool to the heat yours emanates, and rivulets of power echo through your body.)~
@435  = ~(However, just as the pleasure rises to a great crescendo, Tashia's eyes snap open, and she pushes you away with intense fury, and the pleasure suddenly bottoms out into an aching loneliness.)~
@436  = ~(Tears roll down her face, as she utters) Damn you... damn you to the lowest levels of the Abyss, you bastard.~
@437  = ~(She pummels you with her fists) You're no different than Arilistan.~
@438  = ~(Before you can say anything, she turns around, leaving you alone.)~
@439  = ~(Tashia laughs, and puts a finger in her mouth, striking a thoughtful if provocative pose)
Often I swallow what thrusts against me,
when I, encircled by rings, must push
hard against the hard thing, the hole from behind
shove forward what protects
the treasure of my lord in the middle of the night.~
@440  = ~(Place your hand on her thigh, and move it upward slowly) Is it what I think it is? The greatest treasure in all of Amn?~
@441  = ~(Chuckle, and say) Naught girly... the first answer to come to mind isn't always the one you want. The answer is keyhole.~
@442  = ~(Tashia arches an eyebrow, and presses her body forward into yours) And just what were you thinking?~
@443  = ~(She follows your eyes as you slowly travel up her legs, and she gives a laughing) Oh, I see what you mean.~
@444  = ~(Kissing the side of your cheek, she whispers into your ear) The answer was keyhole, just in case you are asked again...~
@445  = ~(Tashia pouts, her white teeth gleaming against the red of her lip) That is entirely correct.~
@446  = ~(Tashia whips her hair around like a blonde whirlwind, and when she stops, a sultry smile crosses her lips, and she rolls her hip) So does my lord possess the... key to my kingdom...~
@447  = ~(She presses her moist lips to your cheek, then runs her tongue along the edge of your jaw-line, before pulling you to the ground...)~
@448  = ~(Tashia comes up to you, and she places both of her hands on your bicep, measuring it with the span of her her hands, and when she pulls them away, she smiles, as she says) Impressive. Most impressive.~
@449  = ~(Grinning, Tashia slowly starts to knead the muscle, and much of the tension that was in the arm slowly disappears under her expert care.)~
@450  = ~(Cocking her head she leans into your side) So, what is my knight in shining armor up to? You've been a bit quiet since you joined the Chapter-House of the Order.~
@451  = ~I've just been doing some thinking, and I don't know where our relationship is headed. I love you Tashia, but sometimes even that isn't enough. I gave my loyalty to the Order, and in so doing, they must come first for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't know if it will work out between us.~
@452  = ~Oh, I wasn't really thinking of anything in particular, just that I wouldn't mind getting out of this armor, and get a nice, hot bath when I can. It might be good for saving one's life, but it isn't exactly the easiest thing on the nose. You know how long it takes to scrub down armor anyway? If you don't mind that is... I could use the company.~
@453  = ~Oh, I wasn't thinking of anything that serious at all. I was just remembering a joke Imoen once told me. I must admit that I laughed at it, but it isn't exactly fit for polite conversation, if you get my drift.~
@454  = ~(Tashia's face flinches, and her eyes narrow down) You know, if you are going to give someone a dismissal, you really should work on your approach.~
@455  = ~(She pauses, cocks her head and looks speculatively at you) You must think I was some kind of simpleton, didn't you? Almost like you didn't think I knew what might happen by getting involved with a paladin.~
@456  = ~(Tashia sighs, and then she adds quietly) If you want to walk away from all that has happened, and might happen, then go ahead. I am willing to give it a try, but the choice is up to you...~
@457  = ~(Smile hesitantly, and say) I'm sorry. Of course I want us to stay together... it's just I thought it was only fair to warn you of what might happen.~
@458  = ~(Look Tashia straight in the eyes for no matter what else happens, she deserves the truth, and say) I think it would be best for the both of us if we separated.~
@459  = ~(Tashia smiles, and she simply says) Then come, my love, whatever happens, happens. That will be tomorrow, but we still have today.~
@460  = ~(She gives a slight chuckle, as she caresses your cheek) Your concern does you credit, but you know... unnecessary worrying can cause wrinkles.~
@461  = ~(Tashia simply shrugs, and says) I guess I should have seen this coming.~
@462  = ~(She tilts her head, gets a long, good look at you) First Arilistan... and now you.~
@463  = ~(Tashia smiles) Why sir, I do believe that was a formal invitation, was it not?~
@464  = ~(She grins, and changes the direction of conversation) Speaking of odor that reminds me of a story I heard. There once was a mama mole, a papa mole, and a baby mole who all lived in a little hole. One day the papa mole sticks his head out of the hole, sniffs the air and says, 'Yum! I smell honey!' The mama mole sticks her head out of the hole, sniffs the air and says, 'Yum! I smell strawberry jam!' The baby mole tries to stick his head out of the hole to sniff the air, but can't because the bigger moles are in the way. So he says, 'Geez, all I can smell is molasses.'.~
@465  = ~(Look at Tashia blankly, waiting for the final punchline, and when it doesn't come blink your eyes, and say) Yes indeed. Very... amusing...~
@466  = ~(Look at Tashia and give a wide, knowing grin, and say) I see your wit is much like a temple. Are you conducting services today?~
@467  = ~(Tashia looks at you, and she shakes her head, and says) Forget about it. It would probably take too long to explain anyways.~
@468  = ~(She glances at the amount of equipment still needed to be attended, the care of your weapons and armor one of the first tenets drilled into any paladin, and she says) Well, I'll leave you to your chores.~
@469  = ~(Tashia laughs back, and she nestles into your arms, momentarily interrupting your cleaning, as she says) You are learning, dear sir, you are learning.~
@470  = ~(She pulls away) When you are done with these chores, I think you need a cleaning as well.~
@471  = ~(Tashia breathes into your ear, her hot breath making the hair sway slightly) I can help with all the hard to reach spots...~
@472  = ~(Tashia grins, and she says) And since when has that ever really stopped me? Now, you realize that since you've told me all of this, you have to tell the joke.~
@473  = ~(Salvage your dignity, and tell her) Um, on second thought, I guess it really isn't appropriate. I'm sorry I even mentioned it after all.~
@474  = ~(Nod, and hesitantly say) There once was a king who was getting sort of bored after dinner one night. He decided to hold a contest of who at the court had the mightiest 'weapon.' The first knight...~
@475  = ~(Tashia gives a sigh, but there is a smile on her face, as she responds) That's okay... for now.~
@476  = ~(She laughs) And they usually talk about women changing their minds, don't they?~
@477  = ~(Tashia looks at you blankly, and for a moment you think that maybe you have offended her, and then she starts to chuckle, her face slowly turning red as she says) Heh, I didn't think you had it in you...~
@478  = ~(She smiles, and says) A bit long-winded, but good, really good.~
@479  = ~(Tashia presses herself in close and says) I think that Imoen was a good influence on you.~
@480  = ~(Tashia comes up to you, and as she speaks, you catch a hint of pride as well as fear in her voice) You're getting pretty good at this, aren't you. You have your own branch of the thieves' guild, you're really becoming someone of notice.~
@481  = ~(There is a pause, and then she asks) But is this what you wish to do for the rest of your life? I must admit I find the idea a bit distasteful, being a thief that is...~
@482  = ~(She sighs, as she says) I mean what if you get caught? By taking control you make yourself that much of a bigger target, or what if some kind of bitter underling decides they could lead better than you.~
@483  = ~(She pauses, and then adds) What if this means that this is going to be the end of us?~
@484  = ~What do you mean, this is going to be 'it' for us? This is just a means to an end, nothing more or less. Whatever else happens, you will always come first for me, Tashia. I mean, we do need gold to go about our own plans. Once I get what I need then I shall pass the reins to another. Besides, who else do I have to keep me honest?~
@485  = ~(Pull her toward you, cradling her in your arms, and swing her around) Why would you even think that? Of course, I will always be the one for you. After all, who am I supposed to dedicate my exploits to? Who will be there to inspire me to ascend the tallest crag, descend the deepest depths, in order to win the most delectable fruit in the world, so that you can feed from my fingers... Who will I be able to splurge my ill-gotten gains on?~
@486  = ~Well, of course I'm getting better at this. If I don't practice, I can't exactly stay at the top, now can I? Don't worry about underlings and such, they aren't anything I can't handle. Besides, one shouldn't worry too much about the future. I mean, live for today, and all that...~
@487  = ~(Tashia's face seems to glow, as your words reassure her, and she replies) That is very heartening to hear. That this isn't going to be a permanent situation, I mean.~
@488  = ~(She sighs, and leans into your side, and you feel her long hair tickling your exposed skin) I guess I'm still a bit afraid of losing you; of you turning on me.~
@489  = ~(Tashia glances directly into your eyes, momentarily losing herself in your gaze, before she says) I apologize for reacting the way I did, though. I apologize if it sounded like I was against thievery. It was more the use to what one puts their skills.~
@490  = ~(She leans in, kissing you as her lips part slightly, and you feel her tongue lick the edges of your lips when she pulls back, and she suddenly cries, and hugs you tightly to her side.)~
@491  = ~(Dabbing her tears away, she smiles brilliantly) I'm sorry. Heh, normally I'm not that overemotional, but that was the sweetest thing someone has said to me in a long time.~
@492  = ~(Tashia's face lights in delight, and she giggles as you take a hold of her hand, kissing each finger tip, and says) Why sir, I do believe you are trying to seduce me.~
@493  = ~(Her eyes dart from side to side, and she leans in, close to your ear) However, I am spoken for...~
@494  = ~(She pulls back, and she says) A man honest and true, one who admired me from afar, though I knew it not, came to me in my darkest hour.~
@495  = ~(Leaning forward, Tashia places her finger on the tip of your nose, and adds) Though if I need a gentleman of words, why, you would be my immediate choice.~
@496  = ~(Tashia finally lets loose with a laugh, and she twists in your arms, holding them close to her chest, and slightly sways, as she relishes being in your presence. She closes her eyes seductively before murmuring pleasantly) Don't think future evasions will be so easy...~
@497  = ~(Tashia looks at you, and her shoulders seem to sag a little) You're looking forward to this, aren't you? I mean, the challenge of running the guildhouse. No, don't deny it or confirm it, I can see it in your eyes. But even more than that, I can see the anticipation of the conflicts to come.~
@498  = ~(She sighs, and shakes her head, as she says) I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. It's the taint within you. Maybe it was foolish of me to think that it would have been any different with you.~
@499  = ~(She leans in and gives a last kiss on your cheek, and then says) As you said, we can't live in the past, but I don't want to just live for today without any thought for tomorrow.~
@500  = ~(As she moves away, she sighs, and says to herself) That's what you get for losing yourself in the moment...~
@501  = ~Heh, you really have turned the playhouse around, haven't you? Now that you are a success, though, it makes me wonder about us... about me. Maybe I'm feeling just a bit jealous of the playhouse, though, for now that you have it, what does that mean between you and me? I mean, I've heard of obsessed artists, after all, that give everything up for the theater. Am I going to become some kind of... acting widow?~
@502  = ~(Tashia growls good naturedly) Yeah, I know, I know, we aren't married at all, but you know what I mean.~
@503  = ~You don't need to worry about that. Plays really don't bring in a lot of money. What I was thinking of doing, though, was to put in some poles, hire some girls... And you know what, put a garland of flowers in your hair... you would probably be the largest draw. I mean, think of it, we could debut you as the Queen of Spring...~
@504  = ~Well, I wouldn't mind running another play when all is said and done. But in the meantime, the stage will not be used for a while... What would you say to hosting a round of riddles? If nothing else, many people wouldn't mind trying to sharpen their wits.~
@505  = ~I don't really know what I want to do. I won't deny that it is nice to have a place to call one's own, but who knows what the future holds? After all, I know that you said you wished to continue traveling, at least for the foreseeable future.I know that I easily see us being together there.~
@506  = ~(Her eyes following your gaze up and down her body, she reaches forward, grasping his jaw in her hand, her jade-green eyes turning a deeper green from her anger, and then she lets your jaw loose with a wrench, her fingers raising red welts on your face.)~
@507  = ~(She comes forward, takes a deep sniff, and growls) I don't smell any alcohol on your breath.~
@508  = ~(Tashia shakes her head, as she draws her arms in close, her foot tapping on the ground) So, what gave you this... brilliant brainstorm, anyway?~
@509  = ~(Shake your hand, and gently grab ahold of Tashia's hand, not exposing any other extremity to her rage) I was just joking Tashia, honest. I'm sorry. I wasn't being serious, I was just trying to lighten the mood up. Heh, sorry if it needed a bit more work. But the one thing I wasn't kidding about was how beautiful you are...~
@510  = ~Well, I mean it's all well and good to run a play, but do you know the final cost? The whole endeavor was running clear in the red. It is a damn wonder I didn't have to borrow some money elsewhere. But think of it this way. You and me, when this is all done, will be working side by side...~
@511  = ~(Tashia's anger subsides somewhat, and she tries to put on a sheepish grin, though she really is having a hard time doing so, and she ruffles your hair as you kiss her hand.)~
@512  = ~Okay, you had me believing you, you got me...~
@513  = ~(She grins, her eyes flashing) But if you want me to dance for you, you are going to have to dance for me...~
@514  = ~(Kissing your lips, she murmurs) But only for an audience of one. I don't like to share...~
@515  = ~(Tashia's anger grows deeper, and she says) If that's how you view me... well, better that I know than before we go any further.~
@516  = ~(Her hand rises rapidly, and slaps you a good one, leaving an angry red welt, as she finishes) And that's for thinking that I am some kind of whore.~
@517  = ~(Tashia's eyes light up, and she moves and plants her lips softly on yours, and for a brief moment you are lost in her tender kiss, when she pulls back and says) That is a sweet thought.~
@518  = ~(She tosses back her hair, and smiles, though she is a bit hesitant, as she adds) And I must admit that it would be nice to go somewhere, where our lives aren't hanging in the balance minute by minute.~
@519  = ~(Tashia pauses, and then adds) Or where even knowing a riddle can be the difference between life and death...~
@520  = ~(Tashia's lips quirk, and she scampers just a bit away and says) I'm told a certain something grows in its pouch, swells and stands up, lifts its covering. A proud bride grasped that boneless wonder, the daughter of a king covered that swollen thing with clothing...~
@521  = ~(Smile at her) Is it... bread dough?~
@522  = ~(Look at Tashia, and smile, as you decide to give a slight pelvic thrust, and say) Is it what I think it is?~
@523  = ~(Tashia's lips puff out as she feigns pouting, and then smiles) Damn. I thought for sure that you would miss that one.~
@524  = ~(She gives a lascivious wink, and then hungrily kisses you again, as she murmurs) I supposes it is a good thing that you can keep your... head... clear...~
@525  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she gives a gentle love tap on your face, as she says) I can see where your mind is at...~
@526  = ~(Giving a saucy leer, she answers) The answer was bread dough...~
@527  = ~(She licks her lips, and lays her hands at the top of your trousers as she whispers) But let's see if we can get rise out of something else...~
@528  = ~(Tashia smiles, and she strides forward and hugs you, saying) Well, I'm glad that whatever we decide to do, you see us doing it together.~
@529  = ~(She pushes the hair from your eyes) But while we are here, there is nothing wrong with enjoying the playhouse...~
@530  = ~(Tashia walks over to you, giving an appreciative 'Hmm...' as you feel her eyes peering over you, much like a woman eyeing a piece of meat in butcher's shop. Tashia circles around you before stopping.)~
@531  = ~(Her face breaks out in a grin, enjoying her slight teasing of you with her actions, and she says) I was expecting Lord <CHARNAME> to be a bit taller. You know, just like the heroes of legend. Seven feet tall, broad shouldered, thighs with which you can break tables, sloping forehead...~
@532  = ~(Tashia leans in then, and kisses your lips, her tongue teasingly darting forward before she steps back. Tashia grabs your hand in hers, and pressing it close to her heart, and says hesitantly) Pardon my teasing, <CHARNAME>. Between the hunt for Irenicus and all your additional duties protecting Nalia's birthright, you seem to be worn thin.~
@533  = ~(Rise up, and remove your hand from Tashia's, and say) That's right, I've been worn thin. People seem to think that I can go on and on, like I'm some kind of thoroughbred horse. And what do I have to show for it? I have people still asking for my help, and I have others snickering behind my back. Oh wait, I now have someone making fun of me in front of my face...~
@534  = ~(Smile at Tashia, and say) I guess that's so. Too many things going on. I apologize if I seemed distant. Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me another of your riddles? I could use the distraction, and the excuse to see your perfect lips speak once more.~
@535  = ~(Grasp Tashia's right hand, bend on one knee, and brush your lips along the back of her knuckles) Fair Maiden, I have slain fearsome dragons, conquered mighty enemies, and braved unspeakable terrors, but next to a mere fleeting moment basking in thine angelic presence, these triumphs pale such as to disgrace my honor. Dear Lady, wilst thou save my honor and grant thy heavenly companionship to me?~
@536  = ~(Tashia looks up in your face, her jovial mood dissipated by the force of your emotion, clutching her hands at her side, not moving from her spot either.)~
@537  = ~(Concern crosses her face, and she embraces you tightly once more, and whispers into your ear) I am sorry, but I never laughed at you. I'm proud of all that you've accomplished, you know that.~
@538  = ~(She kisses you on the cheek, running her fingers through your arm hair, stroking and caressing your skin) Maybe no one else has told you this, but I'm proud of you. I'm sure that Gorion would have been proud of you too. Sometimes I forget how young you are.~
@539  = ~(Then she turns more serious, stroking your face with her index finger) But you're killing yourself with this pace. I know you don't have much choice now, but you need to slow down, the sooner the better.~
@540  = ~(Hold Tashia tight, and kiss her passionately) I love you, you know. You usually know the right thing to say. It it means a lot to me. That you are proud of me, I mean. And you're right, this pace is going to kill me. Heh, honestly, I don't really want power. I just object to idiots having power over me.~
@541  = ~(Look at Tashia, and answer sarcastically) Well, thank you for stating the obvious. I'm so glad that with all I've done, you are proud of me. I'm starting to think that maybe, just maybe, that is the way of the world. The only one you can rely on is yourself, and what you are able to hold in your two hands...~
@542  = ~(Tashia eagerly kisses you back, and she rests her head on your shoulder, and she murmurs in agreement with you.)~
@543  = ~(Tashia gently runs her fingers along the lines of your face, cupping your cheek with her hand, when she says) The one thing I've learned in my years: endure pain, find joy, and make your own meaning, because the world certainly isn't going to supply it.~
@544  = ~(Kissing the side of your neck, tasting the salt on your skin, she says) I guess that's why I'm so quick with a riddle, or a joke. Life is much too short to spend on continuous strife, worry, and sadness.~
@545  = ~(Twining the fingers of her right hand into yours, she steps back, and whispers) But I find joy with you no matter what.~
@546  = ~(Tashia looks stricken at your last comments, but rather than dwelling in sadness, she rises up and the mounting fury of her faces matches your anger.)~
@547  = ~Damn you, you... you bastard. I've heard this talk before, right before Arilistan kidnapped me, and killed me. Even in death he couldn't let me go.~
@548  = ~(Drawing herself up, she looks you straight in the eye, and practically shrieks) Well, I don't want your... love out of some damn sense of obligation. And don't worry, I will be sure not to be in your damn way in the future!~
@549  = ~(Tears slowly coming down her eyes, she growls) I hope you are happy grasping for power, for it's going to be a long, lonely life...~
@550  = ~(She sighs, and holding your hand in hers, she says) Very well. I am valued by men, fetched from afar, gleaned on the hill-slopes, gathered in groves, in dale and on down. All day through the air, wings bore me aloft, and brought me with cunning. Safe under roof, men steeped me in vats. Now I have power to pummel and bind, to cast to the earth, old man and young...~
@551  = ~Soon he shall find who reaches to seize me, pits force against force, that he's flat on the ground, stripped of his strength if he cease not his folly, loud in his speech, but of power despoiled to manage his mind, his hands or his feet. Now ask me my name, who can bind men on earth, and lay fools low in the light of day.~
@552  = ~Love, for just as you have claimed my heart, and laid me low, so can love do for any man.~
@553  = ~Is it mead or wine? For when drunk, it can lay the strongest man low?~
@554  = ~I don't know. What is it?~
@555  = ~(Tashia clenches your hands tightly in hers, a blush climbing over her face, and she says) It's not often that one who has said the wrong answer can still be so right...~
@556  = ~(She leans in, pressing her lips tightly to your mouth, creating a perfect seal so, for just that moment in time, the only thing you are aware of is the feel of her skin on yours, and the warmth of the breath you share, her long blond hair draping itself on your skin.)~
@557  = ~(When she pulls back, a pleasant flush on her face, she says) The answer was honey-mead, but your answer was sweeter than mine...~
@558  = ~(Tashia smiles, and she says) Indeed, it is mead actually, for it is made from honey, the wings that carry it being the flight of bees.~
@559  = ~(Tashia then leans in and kisses you, and as she presses her lips onto yours, you notice how especially sweet her lips are. Tashia then pulls back, and she lifts up a canteen, a sparkle in her eye as she presses it towards you. As you take a deep drought of it, the sweetness is almost too much on your tongue, but this is quickly forgotten as the heady brew makes its way down your gullet.)~
@560  = ~(Just as the brew hits your system, Tashia leans in again to give a kiss, and after another breath-gasping moment, you find that your head is abuzz, though whether due to the kiss or mead is another matter.)~
@561  = ~(She giggles) Sweets for the sweet...~
@562  = ~(Tashia shakes her head, and says) The answer is honey-mead.~
@563  = ~(She gives a pat on your head, and says) That's okay, you'll get it next time.~
@564  = ~(She gives a saucy swing of her hip, noticing the glint in your eye, and she laughs) At least you're preoccupied by something more important now...~
@565  = ~(Tashia catches her breath, and then she smiles, beckoning for you to stand and she gives you a gentle kiss on your cheek. )~
@566  = ~(She then steps back, caressing the side of your face with her hand, and then says, falling into the faux-antiquated language you were speaking earlier) I have faced powerful spirits, magical beasts, and evil men, but 'twas your eyes, m'lord, which finally smote me...~
@567  = ~(There is laughter dancing behind her eyes, and she snuggles firmly into your embrace.)~
@568  = ~(While Tashia lies within your embrace, you look toward the sky and say) I daresay I am up for another riddle. It has been a while since you sharpened your wit on me...~
@569  = ~(Decide to say another line for your beloved, but in a slightly different context) My dear lady, thou art the loveliest creature that hath ever had the generosity to grace our poor, beleaguered world. Thy radiance far outshines that of the sun, moon, and all the stars in the night sky. Now grab your ankles...~
@570  = ~(Tashia seems lost in your words, but at your very last phrase, she starts to laugh, holding you tight to her body.)~
@571  = ~(She peppers your face with kisses, saying) I was wondering how long you could keep that up...~
@572  = ~(A sultry look crosses her face, as she briefly hitches up the side of her skirt, exposing an ankle, and leans provocatively into you, saying) You've broken down my battlements, sirrah and laid siege to my heart...~
@573  = ~(You feel a pair of slender arms wrap around you from behind, and the press of Tashia's head as she leans into your backside) Hmm. You feel real enough to me...~
@574  = ~(She steps in front of you, and there is a smile playing at her lips, as she explains her cryptic remark) Heh. Sorry, I was just thinking of all that you've done. You have managed to defeat a great evil, gained said evil's base of operations, and even managed to make peace with the Cowled Wizards... or some members of it. If I didn't know better, I would have thought someone was just making up a bit of a far-fetched story; that you were a tall tale...~
@575  = ~(Pausing, Tashia changes the conversation and chuckles) So what are you going to do about that grey big iron ball? I wonder if Lavok had some kind of physical issues he was trying to work through...~
@576  = ~Well, I don't know, but since it seems I have the tacit acceptance of some of the Cowled Wizards, I might decide to go into business for myself. There has to be some good money there, somewhere. What I really need is something that is unique...~
@577  = ~Well, now that I think of it, I may continue where Lavok faltered. I think I know just where he went wrong... and with your help, and your magical prowess, I really think that we can succeed where he failed. Just think of it. Eternal life and none of this lich nonsense...~
@578  = ~I don't really know, I figured that at least for the immediate future I would be traveling, with you of course. Maybe I should just rent it out. True, it is not in a prime location, but the fact that the place is practically fireproof, at least on the outside, should count for something...~
@579  = ~(Tashia quirks an eyebrow, and she asks) And what do you mean by... unique?~
@580  = ~(Cup one of Tashia's breasts and placing a hand on her buttocks) Well, the answer is obvious! Magic for cosmetic alterations! We already have illusions to disguise oneself, but those are ultimately fleeting, but I would bet that with just a few alteration spells we could easily corner the market. Just think what we could do with a few Growth spells!~
@581  = ~I guess I don't really have a good idea. Maybe it was just a stupid thing to say. I mean, every time some magician gets beyond the stage of doing party tricks, they always seem to end up in some kind of tower, or being a hermit in some damn cave, and that's assuming they don't go nuts in general.~
@582  = ~Well, truth be known, I was thinking that we could open up some kind of joke shop. Heh, I remember an old joke that Imoen played on me. She found this old bladder, it may have been a cow, but I don't know... and she placed it under my chair as dinner time rolled around, I went to sit. Well, Gorion thought I... expelled some gas. But just think, if we combine that with some kind of low level Stinking Cloud spell, maybe a cantrip even an apprentice could learn...~
@583  = ~(Tashia gives a shriek, and you suddenly find yourself gasping for breath as Tashia brings a sharp elbow up into your midsection, and with a second strike aims her elbow just a bit lower, catching you square in the groin.)~
@584  = ~(She growls) How dare you touch me like that?  And before you start suggesting that women would be receptive for some kind of... augmentation, you might take a look at your own shortcomings...~
@585  = ~(Tashia steps forward, embracing you in her arms, and she says) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the mood.~
@586  = ~(She leans in and gives a kiss on your forehead, and adds) But the fact that you are concerned about that is a good sign.~
@587  = ~(Tashia smiles, as she whispers) And you know, if that's all anyone does, doing party tricks... well, as long as they are happy, there isn't exactly anything wrong with that.~
@588  = ~(Tashia gives a reassuring hug, and then whispers) Whatever else happens, I'm just happy being with you.~
@589  = ~(Tashia's eyes crinkle, hiding the laughter that she is restraining but at the last moment she guffaws, and says) Imoen... did that to you? Why do I have the feeling that many of the products might actually come from things you suffered from her?~
@590  = ~(Tashia shakes her head, and then leans in to kiss you tenderly on the cheek, saying) But I think it's sweet that you can laugh at yourself, unlike...~
@591  = ~(Tashia grows silent, and she whispers) Unlike Arilistan...~
@592  = ~(The silence grows, and then Tashia shakes her long hair loose, and says) Well, come what may, that does sound like an interesting idea...~
@593  = ~(Tashia's face contorts with horror, and she pulls away from you, screaming) You... you beast...~
@594  = ~(She maintains a suitable distance from you, and continues) How can you even entertain such thoughts?~
@595  = ~(Tashia continues to eye you, sudden anger and fear continuing to infuse her face, and she says) Maybe it's the taint within you talking, maybe it's not, but to forget all that we've gone through...~
@596  = ~(She shakes her head sadly, as she makes her way to the edge of the party, and whispers) I don't know...how you could consider something so abhorrent... and frankly, I don't give care to find out. (and she darts away...)~
@597  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she says) Well, I guess you're right. That is definitely something you can do.~
@598  = ~(She pauses and says) You know, though... if you decide to only rent to halflings and gnomes, then you could certainly get more money out of the structure than if you rented to humans. You know, be known as a low-rent place.~
@599  = ~(Tashia shrugs, and says) Sorry, I know that was a bit of a stretch.~
@600  = ~(She reaches forward, and taps your nose, and says) Whatever you decide, it will be fine, I'm sure.~
@601  = ~(Tashia looks at the forest around her, closes her eyes, and takes a deep breath, the tension of your travels eases from her face. When she opens her eyes again, there is a smile tugging at her lips, and she says) You know, in the hustle and bustle of our travels, in the drudgery of trudging around, it is just nice to take one's ease.~
@602  = ~(Tashia gives a small smile, her eyes looking a bit demurely toward you, and then she says) It is kind of liberating being out here, where no one is looking at you, where there are no other expectations except for what you place on yourself.~
@603  = ~(She laughs then, and says) Well, I guess you would know better than I would. After all, you were the one to become a druid, and a Great Druid at that. Doing rather well, if I can keep the stories in place.~
@604  = ~(Tashia gives a small, pleasant sigh, and then she asks) So what are you up to?~
@605  = ~Oh, nothing important. Just thinking. You are right, you know, it's much nicer here in the woods, away from the noise of the cities. Heh, I guess it's no wonder that I was so eager to leave Candlekeep. All those moldy books, the stone walls. The loremasters thought they were protecting themselves, yet, they can't seem to see that they were also imprisoning themselves. Sorry, I guess you didn't come here to listen to a lecture, but I just find myself at ease with you...~
@606  = ~(Bend down on your knees, and push some buds and dark grasses away, plucking a few up) Oh, just doing a little grubbing, you know. Herbs and stuff. No reason to waste magic on something that a simple poultice or potion would do.~
@607  = ~I didn't really have anything planned. Just enjoying being out in nature, I guess, nothing more, nothing less. Why don't you tell me a riddle instead. We have some time to kill, and I do enjoy your mind-twisters.~
@608  = ~Nothing really important. However, if it's not to much, can we proceed along in silence?~
@609  = ~(Tashia embraces you from behind, resting her head on your shoulder. As she looks out at the woods with you, a faint scent of rose reaches your nose, indicating Tashia must be trying a new type of perfume.)~
@610  = ~(Tashia's smile grows a bit larger, and she says) Oh? And just what were you thinking about?~
@611  = ~Faldorn, mostly. No matter what else transpired, she was a druid much like I am. I brought about her defeat, but what if in the long run she was right? I would be lying if I didn't admit if I can't see where she was coming from after all...~
@612  = ~(Grin widely, and prepare to duck) Oh deep thoughts. You know the type, like if a man yells in the woods and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?~
@613  = ~(Laugh) Damn, now you made me forget what I was thinking about. Ah well, it wasn't anything really important anyway...~
@614  = ~(Tashia nods, and she steps in close, embracing you, trying to lift your spirits with her presence, and she whispers) For what it is worth, I don't think that you will be like Faldorn.~
@615  = ~(Grasping your hand, she leans in and kisses the joint of your shoulder and neck) Try not to dwell on it too much, love. That can be just as bad as not considering it either.~
@616  = ~(Tashia just stands by your side, comforting you in silence.)~
@617  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she gives you a light cuff on the head) Well, I guess that will teach me to ask a serious question of you.~
@618  = ~(Her eyes glow with laughter as she asks) But seriously, what are you up to?~
@619  = ~Well, why don't you tell me a riddle. It has been a while since we last did one.~
@620  = ~I was just thinking of gathering some herbs. Hmm... I have a brew that you may care to try.~
@621  = ~Actually, if you don't mind too much, I would just like some time alone. It has been a while since I communed with Nature...~
@622  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she says) Well, I can honestly say I wasn't expecting that answer.~
@623  = ~(She peers curiously at the pouch, and caresses your hand, as she asks) So, just what are you able to make with those plants?~
@624  = ~(Glancing at Tashia's lithe but attractive elven form, you see that her body shows the signs of fatigue) ell you what. I'm going to make something that is bound to make you feel better...~
@625  = ~(Glancing at Tashia's lithe but attractive elven form, you feel your libido rise and decide to make an aphrodisiac) Tell you what. I'm going to make something that is bound to make you feel better...~
@626  = ~Tashia, please, leave me alone. This is hard enough without someone interrupting me. I promise that if there is some time afterward, I will spend it with you. But until then, I really need to concentrate...~
@627  = ~(Tashia drinks the mixture, and her face winces as the foul tasting brew first hits her tongue, but seeing the comforting nod from you, she drinks the entire brew, and then sighs as she whispers) My aches, mypains... they're fading.~
@628  = ~(She gives a furtive yawn, and says) That's an excellent recipe, but you really should figure out something to discharge that awful taste.~
@629  = ~(Her face positively glowing, she leans into you, and wraps her arms around your waist, leaning in to nuzzle your neck, adding) Hmm... I think that I can use some relaxation, tonight...~
@630  = ~(Tashia takes the beverage, and takes a tentative sip, saying) Say, this is good. Really good.~
@631  = ~(She upends the cup and leans in close to you, whispering) Hmm... everything feels funny. It... it feels like there is a buzzing on my insides. My loins feel...~
@632  = ~(Tashia licks her lips as she looks at you, and she grabs your hand, pulling you away from the edges of the party and down into the bushes with her.)~
@633  = ~(As time passes, you emerge from the bushes, bare to the waist, and you feel small rivulets of warm blood flowing down your cool back. Tashia rises as well, but this time there is fury on her face, her fingernails still bloody, pulling her own clothes around her.)~
@634  = ~(She shouts) You... you bastard! You son of a bitch! You drugged me! Why?~
@635  = ~(She howls to the sky, her fury and betrayal plain on her face) Why?!?~
@636  = ~(Tears streaming down her face, she gathers her belongings, and races off into the wilderness, and out of your life.)~
@637  = ~(Tashia clears her throat, and a look of devilment crosses her face, as she says)
I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. 
I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall--I stand up in bed--and whiskery somewhere down below. 
Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. 
She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. 
She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. 
Her eye will be wet... what am I?~
@638  = ~Are you perchance a thorny rose?~
@639  = ~Are you perchance an onion, one that makes a lady cry?~
@640  = ~(Smile, as you know Tashia quite well, and take one of her hand's, and insert it into your trousers, letting Tashia feel around) Is this the answer?~
@641  = ~(Tashia's large smile tells you that you are correct, and she says) Hmm... I really need to find some hard ones, or else you remembered this one from before, the thorn of the rose piercing the fingers of the young maiden, bringing tears to her eyes.~
@642  = ~(She puts her arms around your neck, and draws your head down near hers, and when she kisses you, running the tip of her tongue along her lips, you taste strawberry on Tashia's lips.)~
@643  = ~(As she pulls back, Tashia runs a hand along your cheek, and you see red stains on her fingertips, and her eyes twinkle) I guess its only fair that in light of your herblore that I share the wild strawberries I found earlier...~
@644  = ~(Tashia giggles, and says) Since when is an onion red?~
@645  = ~(She leans in, and kisses you tenderly on the cheek, before pulling apart, saying) I guess even master druids can be wrong at times.~
@646  = ~(Tashia squeezes your hand, and whispers) But you've won the consolation prize... (and she kisses you full on the lips.)~
@647  = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide at your effrontery, and she clenches her right hand, sending waves of pain shooting through your body while a stray thought at the back of your mind admires Tashia's grip.)~
@648  = ~(She growls) Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?~
@649  = ~(She squeezes hard enough to leave you black and blue, and while you are still in her grasp, she punches you hard in the gut with her other hand.)~
@650  = ~I do believe that I shall go to bed alone, tonight...~
@651  = ~(Tashia glances at you, and she shrugs) Okay...~
@652  = ~(Then she advances, wrapping her arms around you, and then she smiles, saying) I think I do understand that as well. Sometimes it's just nice to having nothing to do, having nothing on your mind.~
@653  = ~(She retreats, as she says) I will leave you to your deep thoughts...~
@654  = ~I hope you didn't mind me watching, I guess sometimes I get a bit jealous of the... depth of your devotion.~
@655  = ~(Tashia shakes her head, her hair swirling in a golden whirlwind, before she pushes a few errant strands from her eyes.)~
@656  = ~(You notice that she holds herself tightly as she says) Jealous enough, and worried enough, that I sometimes wonder what will become of us.~
@657  = ~(Smile at Tashia, and say) Tashia, there is enough room for my love and my god. You know, sometimes, the taint lies deep underneath, ready to rise up. Yet, it grows quiescent when I pray. And... and when I'm with you. Have you ever felt such...a connection...to being part of something larger, and yet knowing that even as insignificant as you might be, that you are still important?~
@658  = ~(Cock your head, and pull away slightly from Tashia) If you have so little faith in me, if you have so much doubt in your heart, then I think it may be best that we go our ways. I would no more forsake my faith than I would give up breathing.  am sorry if that is so hard to understand for you...~
@659  = ~(Blow into her long, delicate ear, running your fingers alongside Tashia's skin, and say) You know Tashia, just because one is a cleric doesn't mean they are discouraged from relationships. h, I won't deny that there are some faiths and sects that can be strict in their rules, but most aren't that stringent...~
@660  = ~(Tashia looks in shock at you, her face slowly turning red, and she practically shouts) What the hell?~
@661  = ~(She lunges in, threatening to hit you with the ball of her fist. She stops, and pulls back, deciding that it isn't worth it to hit you.)~
@662  = ~(Pulling away, hugging herself tight, she says) Well, pardon me for coming between you and your religion, you patronizing bastard. I don't know which is worse, the fact you just broke us up, or the unbelievable calm in which you split us apart.~
@663  = ~(She steps in front of you, and you feel a moistness on your face slowly sliding down as Tashia spits, and says) You know, it's people like you that cause me to doubt the necessity of priests. Claiming to be spiritual leaders, you make me wonder why the spirit world needs leaders...~
@664  = ~(Tashia giggles, then a moan escapes her lips from your touch, and she arches her back, cleaving tightly to you.)~
@665  = ~(As her head lowers once more, she gazes lovingly into your eyes, and says) The priests do say that one's body is a temple.~
@666  = ~(Tashia nimbly runs her finger along your chest, gently rubbing in circles) Are you conducting services today?~
@667  = ~(Tashia leans back, clasps your hand and runs it along the curve of her hip. A purr echoes in her throat, and she whispers) Should I consider it a miracle you don't have a vow of chastity?~
@668  = ~(Tashia looks surprised by your question, and for a few seconds, you wonder if you insulted her somehow when she says) Well, before you met me, before I left Arilistan, I would definitely have said yes.~
@669  = ~(A grin crosses her face, and she says) Oh, it's not like I am an atheist of some sort. Rather hard to not believe in the gods when they have a tendency of taking material form at their whim. Heh, and I imagine it's not the safest lifestyle, not unless you are pursuing a career in being a lightning rod.~
@670  = ~(Tashia then smiles at you, and she whispers) But now? I am uncertain...~
@671  = ~(A tear briefly rolls down her cheek, and Tashia says) I mean, when I left with Arilistan, I was certain, absolutely certain that he changed, and...~
@672  = ~(Tashia shakes her head) And you know what happened. But there you were. I couldn't help but wonder, if Hanali Celanil and Sehanine Moonbow had a hand in you finding me, in loving me.~
@673  = ~(Tashia nervously explains) Sometimes I think that it was Sehanine that led you to me. I mean, out of the entirety of Amn, you knew, you absolutely knew where to find me. Then... well, it all happened so fast, but I knew, I just knew I had to tell you how I felt. And to find out how you felt about me... I think it may have been a miracle.~
@674  = ~(Nibble at an ear, and whisper) Then maybe both of us were given a miracle. It would be a shame to squander a gift from the gods, wouldn't it?~
@675  = ~(You decide to change the topic, to help put Tashia at ease.) You know, one thing my deity likes are people that exercise their minds. It has been a while since you last told me a riddle. Besides, keeping in practice is a good way to be near you...~
@676  = ~(Hold Tashia close, and whisper) It may be true that the gods had a hand in our coming together, but the final decision is up to us mortals. And I chose you.~
@677  = ~(Tashia just looks at you for a second, and for the briefest of moments you think you inadvertently said something wrong, when Tashia grasps you tightly.)~
@678  = ~(Pressing in close, you hear Tashia stifle a sob, and feel two wet drops on your back. Silence surrounds the two of you for several minutes as much of the agony and tension flee from Tashia, the accumulated anguish finally given release.)~
@679  = ~(Tashia leans back, giving a final sniffle, her eyes red, raising a hand to wipe away her last tear, her hair disheveled. In that moment, Tashia looks just as lovely as ever, even in the final throes of sorrow.)~
@680  = ~(Tashia then gives a tentative smile, saying) I'm sorry... that was the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.~
@681  = ~(Tashia smiles, and says) I'm afraid that you have me at an impasse. Oh, I have a riddle or two left yet, but I can't guarantee their quality.~
@682  = ~(Leaning back into your arms, Tashia says) Here goes:
Leaning back into your arms, Tashia says, "Anyway, here goes:
I've got a beautiful, beautiful hall
All walled in red velvet
With all white armchairs made of bone
And in the middle a woman dances~
@683  = ~(Press your hand over the swell of her breast) Is it your heart?~
@684  = ~(Kiss her softly) Is it your mouth?~
@685  = ~(Look down at you crotch) Is... that the answer?~
@686  = ~(Tashia's eyes widen with merriment, as she replies) My heart? Only if my chest was split open...~
@687  = ~(She presses her hands over yours, and you feel the beating of her heart, timidly at first, then increasing as a red flush slowly suffuses her body.)~
@688  = ~(Tashia makes no move to leave. Instead, she moves in close, until both of her and your hands are trapped between the press of both your bodies...)~
@689  = ~(Tashia gives a sharp gasp when she finally pulls apart from you, but when she gazes into your eyes, her face takes on a saucy look and licking her lips, she says) You, sir, are correct.~
@690  = ~(Tashia raises your hand to her cheek, rubbing her face on it, her eyes closed, saying) Hmm... I guess you have won that round.~
@691  = ~(She slowly starts slowly kissing your finger, then kissing the flat of your palm, followed by the inside your wrist...)~
@692  = ~(Tashia looks quizzically at you, then giggles as she lays her hand on yours, not moving either, saying) No, silly, it was mouth.~
@693  = ~(Stroking your hand, she breathes huskily) You sometimes have only one thing on your mind, don't you...~
@694  = ~(Tashia steps forward, and she stretches her arms sky-high, a smile playing on her lips as she makes sure she is in a position to give you a good view of her body. As she stretches, Tashia arches her back, before allowing her body to resume its position.)~
@695  = ~(Coming up from behind, she wraps her arms around your body, and licks the edge of your ear, before saying) Hmm. This feels really nice.~
@696  = ~(Tashia gives a sigh, glancing at the woods around her, and she whispers) This reminds me of home. Well, it was a lot colder, a lot whiter... Heh, okay, maybe it doesn't look like home, but it does remind me of home.~
@697  = ~(Tashia looks into the distance, then she says) Heh, sorry to distract you. So, what are you doing?~
@698  = ~(Smile, turn around so that she faces you, and kiss her on the lips) Oh, I don't really have anything planned. I was thinking that some fresh meat would be welcome, so I might go hunting by myself.~
@699  = ~(Look at a nearby bush, seeing a red rose growing there, pluck it and carefully braid it into Tashia's hair, allowing its scarlet to provide some contrast to her gold-colored hair.) Well, I was thinking my lady and I could spend some time together...~
@700  = ~(Grasp her hand, and lean back against a tree, and look into her face, and say) Well, I don't really have anything going on. Tell you what, I would like to try one of your riddles again. Let's see if I have gotten any better at this.~
@701  = ~(Shrug your shoulders, and say) Didn't really have anything in mind. Hmmm, I guess I might go take a leak. Why, is there something you need?~
@702  = ~(Tashia grows quiet, a slight look of disappointment on her face, and then she brightens up) Okay, let me give you this parting thought before you go hunting.~
@703  = ~This happened to a couple I knew back in Targos. There was a man who worked hard all week, but instead of going home, he liked to stay out the entire weekend hunting. When he finally did get home 2 or 3 days later, he was confronted by his very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade about his actions.~
@704  = ~Finally, his wife stopped the nagging and asked him, 'How would you likeit if you didn't see me for two or three days?' ~
@705  = ~To which he replied, 'That would be fine with me.' The first day went by and he didn't see his wife. The next two days came and went with the same results. As the fourth day arrived, the swelling went down just enough where he could see his wife a little out of the corner of his left eye.~
@706  = ~(Tashia smiles sweetly, leans in to kiss you on the cheek, and whispers) I wish you good hunting...~
@707  = ~(Tashia's nose wrinkles, and she says) Eww... thank you for sharing that with everyone.~
@708  = ~(Tashia's face reddens, but she forces her face to smooth out, although you can tell she is still highly irritated and embarrassed.)~
@709  = ~(Shaking her head, Tashia walks away from you, and says) Well, I will let you give your valuable contribution to Mother Nature in peace.~
@710  = ~(Tashia smiles as she shyly turns her face, slightly embarrassed by this sudden display of tenderness, and in that moment you realize that even this outgoing woman likes to be treated as a goddess once in a while.)~
@711  = ~(Tashia then raises her head once more, and she leans into you, allowing her body to press close to yours, feeling the rise and fall of her breasts upon your body as she slowly breathes, and asks) And just what did you have in mind, my lord?~
@712  = ~(You feel that maybe events are moving just a bit fast at this moment, so you stroke her hair, and whisper) Well, I could go for one of your riddles about now.~
@713  = ~(You look down at Tashia, and suddenly feel uncomfortable about how fast this situation is moving, gently pull away from her, and whisper) I don't know. Maybe see what other adornments I can find for you.~
@714  = ~(Not wanting to waste the precious moment, you answer Tashia by pushing her long hair back from her face, and lean in, pressing your lips close to hers, running your other hand up and down the small of her back...)~
@715  = ~(Slowly donning the circlet, she whispers) This is beautiful...~
@716  = ~(Stand back and admire the woman you love as she looks toward you, unconsciously playing with a strand of loose hair. Smile tenderly, and lean in to kiss Tashia.)~
@717  = ~(Grin at her, and give a wink) Well, I guess am just a 'blooming' idiot for you...~
@718  = ~(As you look at Tashia, you feel a withering within you, much like flowers die with the oncoming winter.) Tashia, I think... maybe this has gone too far. I don't mean to hurt you, but you deserve better than this...~
@719  = ~(Tashia's face winces at the bad pun, but then she gives a laugh, turning around and leaning her back into you for support, before saying) Do you carrot all for me? My heart beets for you, with your turnip nose and your radish face, you are a peach. If we cantaloupe, lettuce marry. Weed make a swell pear...~
@720  = ~(Tashia's face wrinkles, and she gives a slight dig into your gut with her elbow, and says) Gods above, now you have me doing it too.~
@721  = ~(Tashia's face crumbles at this betrayal of her emotions, and her face contorts from one of happiness and bliss to one of rage. Swiftly she tears off the floral circle from her head, and throws it directly into your face.)~
@722  = ~(She growls) You...you bastard. How could you do this to me? Are you some kind of sick son-of-a-bitch, that you like to play with someone's emotions?~
@723  = ~(She leans forward, and smacks you, hard enough that you feel a tooth jostle in the back of your mouth, cutting into your tongue. Tashia turns around and tromps away, nothing approaching her in her anger.)~
@724  = ~(Tashia eagerly kisses back, her lips forming a perfect seal around yours, allowing you to taste her breath, and you are reminded of raspberry and acorn, and as she pulls back to catch her breath, you notice red stains on her fingers, and a couple of acorn shell shards still on her clothes.)~
@725  = ~(Tashia's eyes are strangely shiny, and she hugs you tightly to her chest, and whispers) I do love you, you know that...~
@726  = ~(She shudders, as she holds you tight) Ever since Arilistan... (and you feel her slowly emerging tears wet your clothing.)~
@727  = ~(As the tears finally ebb, she pulls back, clenching your hand, and leads you further from the party, and she says with certainty) Come, my love... let's claim this time as our own.~
@728  = ~(Tashia gives a small chuckle, for you know that if she could be said to have one vice, it is that of speaking riddles.)~
@729  = ~(Tashia shakes her head, allowing her hair to fly loose around her shoulders, forming an almost golden crown around her fair face, and she says)
In former days my father and mother, abandoned me dead, lacking breath or life or being.
Then one began, a kinswoman kind, to care for and love me;
overed me with her clothing, wrapped me in her raiment, with the same affection she felt for her own;
until by the law of my life's shaping, under alien bosom I quickened with breath.
My foster mother fed me thereafter, until I grew sturdy and strengthened for flight.
Then of her dear ones, of daughters and sons, she had the fewer for what she did...~
@730  = ~It's a cuckoo, isn't it?~
@731  = ~(Wrap your arms around her) It's you, isn't it?~
@732  = ~(Shake your head in confusion, stumped by the riddle Tashia just asked, and say) Um, we'll have to do this later. I have... a call of nature. Yeah, that's it...~
@733  = ~(Tashia grins, and she says) I should have guessed that you would figure out such an easy riddle. You are right, it is a cuckoo, the bird whose mother lays her egg in another's nest, and then when the egg hatches, the baby cuckoo pushes its 'siblings' from the nest until it alone is left.~
@734  = ~(Tashia leans in, and kisses you on the lips, pressing in close enough so that you feel the warmth of her body. She wraps her hands around your neck, and whispers) I guess I shall have to start using some of the less forest-oriented riddles, shouldn't I?~
@735  = ~(Tashia's eyes widen in surprise, but she doesn't flee from your embrace, and she shakes her head, whispering) No, it wasn't me. The answer is cuckoo.~
@736  = ~(Turning around in your arms, she smiles, and kisses your lips, clasping your hand in hers, saying) But I love the sentiment, silly...~
@737  = ~(Tashia walks over to you, and she runs her fingers along your body, tracing some of the newest cuts you've suffered with her hand, and then tracing some of the faint scars on your body when she pulls back her hand, and her fingertips are bear fresh daubs of blood on them.)~
@738  = ~<CHARNAME>, you're bleeding...~
@739  = ~(Concern crosses Tashia's face, and she pulls you to the side, pulling out a small piece of material, pressing it close to the wounds, staunching the blood.)~
@740  = ~I think we should stop as soon as possible, then we can attend to it properly.~
@741  = ~(Kiss the tips of her fingers, and give her a grin showing that you really feel well) I feel okay, honest. Thank you for your concern, though.~
@742  = ~It's just a flesh wound. I've had worse. But if it will make you feel better, we'll stop as soon as possible.~
@743  = ~(Pull away from her) Do you think I'm so weak that I need you to attend to my wounds? Keep your hands to yourself...~
@744  = ~(Tashia shrugs, and says) Very well, that's your choice. I would like you to think on something though. Most of the time, people say they are okay...~
@745  = ~(She opens her hands) The reason? Because at that moment they aren't dying.~
@746  = ~(She sighs, and states) Sorry, it's a morbid thought. I'm just saying that if one can stop and get healthy, then it's probably a good idea...~
@747  = ~(Tashia smiles) I am glad that you agree. About stopping, that is...~
@748  = ~After all, life is nothing but a near death experience...~
@749  = ~(Tashia shrugs, rising, and she says Fine, have it your way.~
@750  = ~(She starts to walk away, before stopping, and states) Bear in mind that a graveyard always starts with a single body...~
@751  = ~Ugh... will you take a look at this? Stand up to the wind and rain, my ass. Guaranteed to last for years.~
@752  = ~(Tashia displays one of her tunics, and you see there are several rents and tears in it, some undoubtedly due to the various conflicts the pair of you have been in, the inclement weather that occasionally dogs your footsteps, and other holes just from age.)~
@753  = ~One of these days, they will invent a material that stands up to the rigors of travel.~
@754  = ~And I'm not going to don just a leather bustier and thong. Maybe some of these wannabe sword-bunnies like to wear it all day long, but you know what sweaty leather smells like? And I just don't know what goes on in their mind as to how that will protect them. Maybe they figure they can distract the men by flashing their breasts.~
@755  = ~(Tashia stops her momentary tirade, and looks sadly at her clothing once more. She sorts through a few other pieces, momentarily stopping at one, tearing it up in her hands mumbling about it not even being fit for rags.)~
@756  = ~(Walk over to Tashia, and press about 100 gold pieces into her hand, hoping that maybe you can buy her out of her seeming bad mood.) Here, this should be enough to buy you a whole new wardrobe. I've got a few things to round up myself, but I will meet you back at the inn.~
@757  = ~(Kiss her, and say) I don't know. I can think of a few things we could do instead of shopping. Besides, I can see where this would have its uses... (and hold one of her shirts that has a rather large gap near her breast, pressed to the outside of her clothes)~
@758  = ~Just what is it with women and clothing? I guess I should be glad that you don't break down at the sight of spiders, and start crying, but damn...~
@759  = ~(Take her hand, and say) I didn't even think that things were getting that thread-bare, but now that you mentioned, you are right. Tell you what, let's go get some new clothes... my treat. Besides, it will give me an excuse to be with you longer.~
@760  = ~(Tashia hefts the money in her hands, and she glances at you, and smiles) You know, I do have enough money of my own.~
@761  = ~(She tosses the money back to you, and then leans in to give you a slight peck on your cheek) Thanks for the consideration, though. I'll meet you back at the inn then...~
@762  = ~(Tashia walks forward, her left arm sliding down around your waist, looks up into your eyes, and gives you a light slap on the forehead.)~
@763  = ~Is that all you can think of? (She grins, before stepping forward to press her lips onto yours, and then she gives a slight sigh when she pulls apart.)~
@764  = ~(There is a twinkle in her eyes as she puts away the shirt, and says) Tell you what. When I get back, then...~
@765  = ~(Tashia looks at you, and anger courses through her face) And sometimes I have to wonder about you guys. Tell me, is it some kind of machismo that tells you guys to open your mouth and stick your foot all the way in? Maybe it's satisfactory for you to run around in a plain loincloth, letting your privates be exposed to the elements. Tell you what, the next time you get cold, I'll let you warm yourself up. Maybe when your ass freezes off, you'll learn to curb your tongue...~
@766  = ~Are you really sure about that? I mean, I normally don't care to go shopping myself. Okay, let's go...~
@767  = ~(She pauses, and there is a twinkle in her eye, as she grabs hold of your arm, and proceeds to the nearest store, entering it...)~
@768  = ~Well, I'm done with my shopping... what is that you have there?~
@769  = ~(Smiling, you give Tashia the pelt, and her eyes grow wide. Dropping her package onto the ground, she runs her fingers through the fur.)~
@770  = ~(A slight trembling in her body, she looks into your eyes) Who is this for?~
@771  = ~This is yours, of course.~
@772  = ~(Tashia notices the cloak in your hand) Who is that for?~
@773  = ~This is beautiful... (she raises it to her cheek, rubbing her face alongside it) And so soft...~
@774  = ~(A tear streaks down Tashia's face, but she smiles, stepping forward, and entwining her fingers into your head, and presses her lips to yours, and when the kiss finally breaks Tashia takes a couple of small gasps, her face filled with wonder and love.)~
@775  = ~Thank you...~
@776  = ~Well, that's that. I managed to bargain everything down to about 10 gold pieces.~
@777  = ~(Tashia pulls the cape tight around her, and she gives a small purr of pleasure.)~
@778  = ~This is... nice (she whispers, her eyes closing as she pulls the cloak tight around her, accentuating the swell of her breasts for the briefest of moments.)~
@779  = ~(Tashia's face blushes, as she suddenly realizes her reaction, but there is a non-repentant smile on her face as she steps in to kiss you on the cheek.)~
@780  = ~(As you make your way inside, you see that there is a large variety of clothing and armor inside of it. Upon entering, Tashia starts to examine the clothes rack. Noticing the shopkeeper and seeing the exhilarated expression on Tashia's face, you can almost feel the gold coins leaving from your pouch and into hers.)~
@781  = ~(Now that you and Tashia are more comfortable together, you think it might be a good idea to visit your stronghold with her.)~
@782  = ~(Moving her arm in gentle circles to release some of the tension, while your other hand presses gently into her diaphragm, you feel her body heat rise with your very touch, the rise and fall of her chest, her backside pushing up close to you.) Breath is life. We should pay as much attention to it as any other aspect of being.~
@783  = ~(Stand solemnly beside her, feeling the wind swirl around you, her hair flying loose like a whirlwind, and whisper) In spring, hundreds of flowers; in autumn, a harvest moon. In summer a refreshing breeze; in winter, snow will accompany you. If useless things do not hang in your mind, any season is a good season for you...~
@784  = ~(As you look through your supplies, you find enough items to make a rather generous helping of sausage along with a small container of lard and flour, enough to make some hard biscuits with sausage filling. Additionally, searching the countryside quickly reveals a ready source of dandelions nearby, as well as some wild onions.)~
@785  = ~(Looking at the items, and not feeling all that eager to try your hand at making the meal, say) Tell you what. The next inn we come across, you order whatever you want... price no object.~
@786  = ~(With the sausages and flour, you create some biscuits, stuffing the sausage inside, while supplementing the insides with chopped onions and dandelion stalks.)~
@787  = ~The first knight stood up and proclaimed that he had the mightiest weapon. He pulled down his pants and tied a 5-pound weight around it. The weapon then rose. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, and the band played appropriate music.~
@788  = ~Another knight stood up and yelled that he had the mightiest weapon. He dropped his pants and tied a 10-pound weight to himself. The weapon also rose. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, and the band played appropriate music. After several more knights tried to prove their superiority, the King finally spoke out. 'I have the mightiest weapon of them all!'~
@789  = ~He dropped his pants and tied, not a 10-pound, not a 20-pound, not even a 30-pound, but a 40-pound weight to himself. The weapon did rise. The men cheered, the women swooned, the children waved multi-colored banners, the band played and the crowd screamed 'God Save the Queen!'~
@790  = ~(It has been some time since you could go through an entire workout without disturbance. Between the search for Imoen and Irenicus, the various conflicts that seem to erupt in your passage, the multitude of people on your tail, and the general hustle and bustle within the city, it seems like it has been weeks, if not months, since you last had a proper physical workout.)~
@791  = ~(Moving through the various stances and poses, some of your muscles protest under the strain you put them under, but thankfully you are able to finish the entirety of your exercises.)~
@792  = ~(As you finish up, you notice Tashia standing stock still, her green eyes avidly following your every move. When you finish, she walks over and slides her arm into yours, stands close to you, and kisses you deeply.)~
@793  = ~One of the primary tenets of my school is balance. One mind, one body, two become one.~
@794  = ~(Gently moving her arm in gentle circles to release some of the tension, while your other hand presses gently into her diaphragm, you feel her body heat rise with your very touch, the rise and fall of her chest, her backside pushing up close to you.) Breath is life. We should pay as much attention to it as any other aspect of being...~
@795  = ~(Smile, and say) This is the simplest of the breathing exercises, Tashia.~
@796  = ~(Whisper) Close your eyes, empty your mind of all thoughts. Take a deep breath, then exhale all stale air from the lungs, contracting abdominal muscles to squeeze out the last remnants. Inhale through the nose making a snoring sound.~
@797  = ~And pay no attention to the snoring... vanity is but a roadblock along the path.~
@798  = ~(As she breathes, continue by saying) Hold your breath for seven seconds, then exhale through the nose, making an air sound from your palate. Focus on the sound during inhalation and exhalation, on the vital life force being stored and saved during breath retention.~
@799  = ~(You finish your prayers to your deity, when you notice Tashia looking intently upon your form. As you return her look, a slight smile tugs at her mouth. When you approach, she walks forward, embracing you tightly, then pulls away.)~
@800  = ~*giggles*~
@801  = ~Anyway, I gathered my things, and hurried over to Phlydia. She liked my gift... except for one thing... that bundle with the red leaves? How was I supposed to know that it was poison ivy! And of course, it felt like my whole body was on fire. It didn't help that all of the monks decided to try their pet theories on how to get rid of the itching...~
@802  = ~(Imoen chuckles) You see, they decided this would be a good lesson for him, and wouldn't take him to see the cleric. Although, I have to say, mixing that tomato with garlic wasn't one of the better methods...~
@803  = ~Yeah, but you weren't the one who had to sleep outside until the stench wore off...~
@804  = ~(Imoen raises her head, and she starts to giggle) Don't believe a word he says... he just was shifting blame elsewhere... although it caught up with him sometime... you ever hear of cow-tipping?~
@805  = ~(Tashia looks appraisingly at you) No, what is cow-tipping?~
@806  = ~(Imoen takes a more serious look) Well, did you know that cows sleep standing up? The idea is to sneak up on them while they're sleeping and hit them with your weight to knock them over. The problem is that the cows can get hurt from this...~
@807  = ~(You start to blush, as she points toward you) Well, laughing boy there slipped on the manure, and just as the cow was slipping, it landed on him. He broke poor Nessie's fall... and his ribs...~
@808  = ~And how did you see all this happen?~
@809  = ~You didn't think I would let him go without some supervision, did you? Needless to say, Dreppin came running in at all that ruckus... and after letting the priest see to his hurts, <CHARNAME> was given extra chores... you mucked stables out for three months, didn't you?~
@810  = ~(Tashia smiles, though there is also some gentleness that crosses her face) Don't worry. I will spare you from all the immediate jokes. I'm sure you heard them all back then, and you certainly don't need them now...~
@811  = ~(Her eyes seem shiny, as she finishes) But I always liked a man who could laugh at himself...~
@812  = ~(Tashia laughs, and she says) And just what sort of adornments did you have in mind?~
@813  = ~(Quickly searching the environs reveals a variety of other flowers, and soon you come back. You use the skills you have for making traps and snares for animals until you have an exquisite floral crown, vibrant with pink carnations, peach chrysanthemums, yellow lilies, and white roses, in your hand. The various flowers give off a heady perfume, and Tashia's eyes turn shiny when you hand her the flowery circlet.)~
@814  = ~(Tashia stops by a bush, a thin woody climbing plant slightly entwined the trunk of a small tree, yellow-green in color. After further examination, Tashia starts to pluck small bluish-purple crescent shaped, compressed berries, putting them in her belt pouch, before popping a few in her mouth, swallowing immediately, and her face contorts with disgust, and she immediately spits out the remnants, pouring the other fruits from her belt pouch.)~
@815  = ~(Jaheira, hearing the sound, looks over with interest) Tashia, just what is going on?~
@816  = ~(Tashia wipes her mouth of the foul acrid taste) Something is wrong with these grapes. Its even worse than biting into a lime.~
@817  = ~(Jaheira examines the bush in turn) Hmmm... well, first thing, there is nothing wrong with this bush.~
@818  = ~What do you mean there is nothing wrong?~
@819  = ~This is Moonseed. Its fruit looks like grapes, but they aren't. In small amounts it is actually a good laxative, as I'm sure you will find out.~
@820  = ~(Tashia clutches her sides, with an anxious look on her face) What do you mean, I will find out?~
@821  = ~Just be glad you didn't eat more than a small handful. It could cause purging.~
@822  = ~I said, what do you mean I will find out?~
@823  = ~(She smirks) Come, Tashia, I didn't think you were that hard of hearing. I said that it was a diarrhetic. I highly recommend that when you... leave, you keep an eye out for the poison sumac.~
@824  = ~(Tashia's face reddens slightly) Isn't there anything you can do to help me?~
@825  = ~(Jaheira shakes her head) No. One shouldn't use one's spells casually. Not when the matter will resolve itself. Let... Nature take its course.~
@826  = ~Move yer candy ass out of my way, long ears, or else ye will find me axe buried up to the hilt in yer skull...~
@827  = ~Oh, and why is that, you gnarled dirt-grubber?~
@828  = ~The answer be very simple, tree hugger. If I have to spend another minute with yer yammering without a protective layer of ale to fortify me, I shall start swinging me axe.~
@829  = ~You know, I could assist you by planting it in your pointy head.~
@830  = ~Ye better count yer blessings, bat-ears, that I be more thirsty for alcohol than blood at the moment.~
@831  = ~(Korgan sits down and proceeds to down several steins of ale.)~
@832  = ~Barkeep... two for me.~
@833  = ~And just what do ye think yer doing? ~
@834  = ~I'm just taking my refreshment here... got a problem with that, half-pint?~
@835  = ~Whatever... just don't stink up the bar with yer flowers.~
@836  = ~(As time passes, Korgan notices how much Tashia is putting away)~
@837  = ~Yer not doing too badly there for a la-dee-da flower kisser.~
@838  = ~Well, I have to have a way to keep the bile from rising into my mouth due to present company.~
@839  = ~At least ye got spirit, long ears, I'll grant ye that.~
@840  = ~Don't try to sweet talk me, Korgan. Tell you what... up for a friendly wager?~
@841  = ~And what's that?~
@842  = ~I got 100 gold pieces that says 'I can drink you under the table'.~
@843  = ~Har har! Are ye serious? If ye are, then put yer money where yer mouth is, girlie.~
@844  = ~(Tashia places her coins on the bar, Korgan matches it, and they both start to drink. Several hours pass, but by this point, their 'friendly' wager is forgotten, and in fact, they both start to sing, Korgan in a guttural bass, and Tashia in a high soprano)~
@845  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Can you throw them over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?
Do your balls hang low?

Ting-a-ling, here's a lesson
That you best not be forgettin'
If you can't get it up for a lovin' session,
Tarragon and gingsing,
Will fortify your dink,
Do your balls hang low?~
@846  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Do they make a lusty clamor
When you hit them with a hammer?
Do your balls hang low?

Ting-a-ling, all you women
If you want some sexy sinnin'
Use your cotton sheets
Not your satin linen,
Cause you will get a lumpy head
From slipping off the bed,
Do your balls hang low?~
@847  = ~Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them in a bow?
Do they have a hollow sound
When you drag them on the ground?
Do your balls hang low?

Ting-a-ling, its hot
And a beer would hit the spot
To be followed with a triple whiskey shot
But if you want to stick with beer
Hold your licker by the ears
Do your balls hang low?...~
@848  = ~Ooh, by the goddess... it feels like I got run over by a herd of cattle. Did anyone see the driver of that donkey cart?~
@849  = ~Okay, now where did I get this horned helmet?~
@850  = ~AAARGH! Where did these pink knickers come from!?!~
@851  = ~Hey Minsc, do they enjoy stories from where you are from?~
@852  = ~When the skalds stir to play, any true warrior of Rasheman heeds to their tales! Why, even Boo's righteous passion is quelled when they speak.~
@853  = ~Oh, I just want your opinion on a story. A man walks into an inn, and he orders a steak. The serving wench gave him a quick once over, and she said, 'I don't think so... you don't look like you can afford a glass of water, let alone a steak.' The guy nods in agreement, but replies, 'But what if I show you something that you haven't seen before, will you then give me my supper?~
@854  = ~Hmm... Boo says that one really should have the money to pay for their dinner.~
@855  = ~And Boo is one intelligent hamster. Now please let me continue... so, anyways, the waitress agrees and the man reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a tiny harpsichord and from the other a small hamster.~
@856  = ~Ooooh, this may be one of Boo's relatives. You didn't tell me you had a musician in the family.~
@857  = ~Yes, yes... well, the hamster starts to play up a storm and the waitress' eyes open wide, and she calls the innkeeper to come take a look. Everyone in the inn is now looking at the hamster, but the man reaches into a third pocket, and pulls out a green item... he places it on the counter, and everyone sees that it is a frog, and as the hamster plays, the frog starts to sing.~
@858  = ~A singing frog? Boo has never heard of such a one before.~
@859  = ~A wealthy merchant saw what was happening, and he said, 'How much for the frog and hamster?' The stranger shook his head, and said that the hamster wasn't for sale, but he could part with the frog for 300 gold pieces. As the greedy merchant went to his room, the waitress looked at the stranger, and asked, 'Are you insane? Giving up a singing frog for that much? It must have been worth thousands.' The stranger smiled, and he said, 'No, it wasn't. The hamster is a ventriloquist.~
@860  = ~A ventriloquist? Say it can't be so! The hamster is a foul thief! Boo's fur is all wiry in righteous anger! If we meet up with this deceptive rodent, we must apply the boots of justice to his backside!~
@861  = ~(Viconia glances appraisingly at Tashia) I wouldn't even give it a half a day...~
@862  = ~(sigh) Okay, Viconia, I give. Just what wouldn't take even half a day?~
@863  = ~It is nothing much, surfacer. I was just considering how long it would take to make you break on the rack...~
@864  = ~Oh, and you estimate that I wouldn't last even half a day? I'm so glad that you think so highly of me.~
@865  = ~Oh, don't act so insulted...~
@866  = ~That's right, isn't it. You participated in their bloodsports, didn't you? That explains it entirely.~
@867  = ~Believe it or not, I did find their practices distasteful, but when a matron mother is overlooking your shoulder, you learn quickly how long a victim will last. When to apply the last stroke of the lash, when to pull the last turn of the crank...~
@868  = ~You are quite proud of this, I take it?~
@869  = ~Of course, ibblith. I survived when many of my sisters did not, let alone many others. One who is not strong and adaptable soon finds themselves amongst the lower ranks, or discarded, like so much refuse.~
@870  = ~Well, I won't deny your strength. But for all the competition, all the strife, the drow are not exactly commanding too many surface kingdoms, now are they?~
@871  = ~That is true. Don't think I am foolish enough to disagree with the obvious. That constant conflict is also one of our greatest weaknesses. One doesn't need to be a tactical genius to see that. Our conflicts amongst ourselves does little to allow our power to be extended... and our treachery is so legendary that even normal enemies will band together to weaken us, bring us down if at all possible. But, even with all of this, it is a testament to our prowess that we still survive.~
@872  = ~(snort) Well, pardon me if I don't exactly sing the exploits of your prowess...~
@873  = ~Tashia, have I ever told you that you are coming quite nicely into your powers? Why, with just the proper instruction, I'm sure that you may even be worthy of being in my presence. (Yes, let's see how she reacts to my proposal.)~
@874  = ~Okay, Edwin, I'm just getting a bit tired, so I don't really have the energy to verbally joust with you. What are you getting at?~
@875  = ~Nothing, my dear, just stating the obvious. Why, with the proper training, as I just said, you could certainly deserve...~
@876  = ~You do realize that I'm not a proper wizard? Just how do you expect me to learn spells when all my magic comes from within?~
@877  = ~That's just it, Tashia... your power comes from within, it's as if you internalize all your spellbooks. Imagine what a wondrous advantage that is. Though it shames me to admit it, at times even I can see where that ability is greater than sheer memorization.~
@878  = ~(with a thoughtful glance on her face) The great Edwin, admitting shame? Okay, who are you, and what have you done to the real Edwin?~
@879  = ~Hear me out. It could be that as you grow stronger, the spells you display are founded on some internal desires. Why, if we could just channel that...~
@880  = ~And how would we channel that?~
@881  = ~Well, why don't you come to my bedroll this evening, and I will give you your first lesson.~
@882  = ~(Tashia bursts out in laughter) Edwin, I will give you some points for subtlety, at least for you. However,thanks, but no thanks. I'm afraid that you will have to sleep alone once more this evening.~
@883  = ~(Damn. So close, yes, so close...)~
@884  = ~(As the group walks along, the moon is bright in the sky, and Tashia's hair appears to glow in the darkness. Haer'Dalis gives out a small gasp, at this, and he walks toward her, a faraway stare in his eyes.)~
@885  = ~But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east...~
@886  = ~So help me, if you say, 'Tashia is the sun...' I shall kick you so far where the sun don't shine that my foot will be coming out of your mouth.~
@887  = ~Why, fair elf, do the words displease you?~
@888  = ~Only when they have been done to death. How often do you think that I can hear things like

O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head

or some other such nonsense? I mean...sure, it may be a well turned phrase, but it gets boring after awhile...~
@889  = ~Forgive me, then. I was but complimenting your beauty--~
@890  = ~Why is it all bards always have to compliment a woman on her beauty? Why don't you guys try something original for a change. I mean, I'm sure even Milil gets tired of hearing the same thing day after day.~
@891  = ~Calm down, my swan...~
@892  = ~Every single time, it is usually some variation about a figure that won't quit. From there, the list expands to include skin like satin, hair of the softest gold, and a chest fit for a herd of cows. You think we like being described in a way similar to livestock?~
@893  = ~LTashia, you are taking this much too seriously!~
@894  = ~Oh really? Can I help it if it feels like you bards have some other agenda? It's almost always the woman who needs rescuing. It is always the woman who is the wicked stepmother. Either you guys want to keep us safe in a box, or bury us in one... six feet under.~
@895  = ~(Haer'Dalis looks at Tashia, and he beats a hasty retreat, muttering under his breath)~
@896  = ~You better not say 'that time of the month...' either.~
@897  = ~(Aerie walks up side by side with Tashia, a perplexed expression on her face. So drawn into thought, she accidentally bumps into her.)~
@898  = ~Oh, sorry Tashia...~
@899  = ~It's okay. Hmmm... just out of curiosity, would you mind telling me what is on your mind? You seem to be elsewhere, at least mentally.~
@900  = ~Oh, its nothing, or I don't think it is. It's just that as we left that last town, while everyone was busy getting supplies and everything, I was refilling our canteens when there was a man, eyeing the passing traffic. He might have been a thief, since he seemed to be taking in everything that went by. Anyways, he looked directly at me, and he seemed to get this weird... I hesitate at calling it a smile, but he gave this smile, walked over, grasped my hands, and said, 'I have faced powerful spirits, magical beasts, and evil men, but 'twas your eyes, milady, which finally smote me.~
@901  = ~And what did you do?~
@902  = ~What could I do? All I remember is that time seemed to stop, and I spent a lot of time looking down at my feet... and then I heard someone calling my name to keep up, and I hurried to catch up. But the man seemed bemused by my blush.~
@903  = ~(Tashia smiles, though there is a tight edge to it) Sounds like someone just tried a pick up line on you.~
@904  = ~A pick up...line?~
@905  = ~Yeah, that's where a stranger tries to talk with you, mainly because he finds you attractive and would like to get to know you better.~
@906  = ~But why? Why would someone try to talk to me in that way... at all? I mean... why would anyone...~
@907  = ~Not that women are to my taste, but I think the answer is very simple, Aerie. You are a beautiful woman... too be honest, I'm surprised that someone hasn't tried to be with you as it is.~
@908  = ~Funny. They may think that... but they don't know that I'm deformed, do they... ~
@909  = ~(Tashia sighs, as she realizes that Aerie is about to go into another bout of self-pity, and rapidly changes the subject to head it off.)~
@910  = ~At least you had a decent first line... mine was much worse.~
@911  = ~What do you mean?~
@912  = ~How would you have reacted if someone told you 'Pardon me, madam, but your beauty has caused an involuntary lowering of my drawbridge. If I show you where the handle, is can you crank it back up?~
@913  = ~(Aerie blushes furiously) Oh my...~
@914  = ~Say Tashia, you may have heard of my deeds with the Hillgnasher Giants. But have you also heard...~
@915  = ~Anomen, give it a rest already.~
@916  = ~Something wrong, milady?~
@917  = ~I'm sure I'm not the only one that has felt this way, and I'm sure that you are probably correct in your deeds. Indeed, if true, then there is reason to be proud... but that doesn't mean you should be so boastful about it.~
@918  = ~Me, boastful? Those are harsh words, my lady. How can it be boasting when it is simply the truth?~
@919  = ~Truth or not, but that seems to be the only thing coming out of your mouth. As I already said, there is nothing wrong with taking pride in your deeds, but if that is the only thing that you can talk about, then you live a mighty empty life. Frankly, its a wonder...~
@920  = ~(Anomen splutters, and interrupts) If that is the case, then why is it that most of the ladies back in Amn hung on my very word?~
@921  = ~Well, as it is unlikely I'll be able to hobnob around the rich and famous, I can only hazard a guess or two. But the first is that some of them were genuinely interested...~
@922  = ~But, you just said...~
@923  = ~Of course I said that it sounds very arrogant to talk of your exploits time after time, but that doesn't mean others don't find them fascinating. Have you considered the circumstances of the average woman of nobility?~
@924  = ~Consider...?~
@925  = ~(sighs) The average noblewoman tends to lead a very boring life, compared to the men, anyways. Unless they have an understanding father, or are strong enough to set out on their own. There is a very small range of allowable behavior for them. You don't see too many noble ladies taking up a life of adventuring, now do you?~
@926  = ~Well, no...~
@927  = ~Of course not. I mean, it seems to me that a woman is mainly expected to solidify social connections, and assure the next generation of nobles. Hell, even ones that are into horse riding, hunting, or falconry are looked down on just a bit as well.~
@928  = ~You are right...~
@929  = ~Anyways, to get back to my point... when you tell your stories - and you do tell them rather energetically and vividly at that, even if it gets old after a while of the same thing - you draw them into in, and for a brief moment, you show them a life that doesn't bind them.~
@930  = ~But then, what am I supposed to tell them... afterwards?~
@931  = ~(Tashia pauses thoughtfully) Tough nut there, I admit. I mean, when I think of women of 'high station', I get images of obsessive weavers and compulsive dressmakers in mind. Maybe you can break the ice with a joke...~
@932  = ~A joke? Surely you jest!~
@933  = ~(winces) And I would stay away from the bad puns...~
@934  = ~So you're Imoen! I'm pleased to meet you. To be honest, I was wondering whether you really were alive or not.~
@935  = ~Heh, well, I was wondering what was keeping <CHARNAME>... its not like <PRO_HIMHER> to be so late.~
@936  = ~(Tashia smiles, then changes the topic so as not to bring up some recent unpleasant memories) Heh, you know, you remind me of my younger sister.~
@937  = ~Really, I do? Younger sister, huh. Just how many brothers and sisters did you have?~
@938  = ~(she smiles, thinking of pleasant memories) There were five of us altogether. We were orphans really, but one family took us in. Heh, sometimes I wonder what possessed my foster parents to take us all in.~
@939  = ~Just like <CHARNAME> and I with Gorion. Well, truth be known, mainly me. Not that <PRO_HESHE> didn't have <PRO_HISHER> moments, but <PRO_HESHE> was always more serious of the two of us.~
@940  = ~Yeah, you know. I remember back... oh, I must have been about 12... anyways, with so many kids there, money could get to be quite tight. Well, my older brother, Ilyan, had this great idea that would save us time and money. When we weren't doing chores around the house or anything like that, Ilyan usually was drafted to watch us, being the oldest of us all. But he also loved fishing. It wasn't until he got the rest of us hooked that we were able to supplement the dinner table. Anyways, Ilyan got the idea that instead of constantly trying to catch fish for the table, it would be better for us to raise our own.~
@941  = ~I think I see where this is heading...~
@942  = ~Of course. So, one day while our foster parents went to town to sell our produce and such, we all went out back and dug a big hole. Probably wasn't no more than 5 feet wide, maybe 3 feet deep, but it seemed like it was much larger. That's a lot of dirt for a group of kids to move. Anyways, we then took buckets of water and started filling it. Anyways, we were about done when our foster parents came in. Well, nothing more happened, dinner was served and whatever. Anyways, it starts to get late, and so we go to bed. The sun had just set, and our foster father needed to go use the privy... did I mention it's an outdoor privy? Next thing we know, we hear screaming and swearing coming from outside, and our foster father is busy bellowing for us all to come down.~
@943  = ~I gather you didn't keep your ditch?~
@944  = ~Of course not. You see, once he calmed down, our foster-father said that since we liked digging so much, we could muck out the barn. I swear, we couldn't get rid of the odor for a week from our clothes.~
@945  = ~Mazzy, may I ask a question?~
@946  = ~Sure you may. In fact, I think you just did.~
@947  = ~(her lips cracking slightly) Why Mazzy, a joke... I didn't think you had it in you.~
@948  = ~(Mazzy smiles) Well, I may not be as adept as you at constructing a fair turn of phrase, Tashia, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a well crafted phrase.~
@949  = ~Oh, it's like anything else, I imagine. Whatever you put your mind to, you can usually learn.~
@950  = ~Yes, although I can understand the urge of a crowd if a jester gets up there and starts asking, 'Why do knights ride stallions in the day?' and the inevitable reply is, 'Because they don't like nightmares'. Anyways, you said you wanted to ask me something?~
@951  = ~Yes, I did. Well, with all that we've been through, it seems like I'm using my magic more and more. And with that period in Trademeet... well, would it be possible for you to help me get my staff work back up to par?~
@952  = ~Sure, Tashia, I wouldn't mind... but are you sure? I'm sure there are plenty of others in the party that could help you just as easily.~
@953  = ~No, there really isn't. The last time I asked for help, the fool put his arms around me, and grabbing the staff with both hands said, 'Fighting is like everything else : it's all in your thrust...~
@954  = ~(winces) I hope you put the churl in his place.~
@955  = ~Well, last I heard, they managed to find a cleric good enough. But walking with a dislocated kneecap has to be painful...~
@956  = ~Ouch!~
@957  = ~Tashia, quiet. Too much shouting distracts even me from listening for possible trouble...~
@958  = ~That's easy for you to say. Tall, dark, handsome, and brooding...~
@959  = ~What do you mean by that?~
@960  = ~You heard what I said. (Tashia lifts her arm slightly, and where her other hand is applying pressure, you see it starting to swell and redden. She almost jerks her arm away from Valygar when he reaches out to look at it.)~
@961  = ~Tashia, if you don't stop that this instant, I can't see what's wrong. I don't bite, you know.~
@962  = ~(Further examination reveals that there is a bee sting on Tashia's arm, and carefully, taking water from his canteen, he cleans the area thoroughly, and then with the flat edge of his dagger, removes the stinger.)~
@963  = ~(Tashia's face flinches slightly, and she barely rasps out, her eyes watering, giving a dry cough) Just what are you doing?~
@964  = ~(Tashia gives one more shriek, as Valygar pulls her down to the ground, making her lie flat, and he partially tears open her blouse, laying his hands on her shoulders. Tashia starts to tremble under Valygar's hands, her eyelids fluttering rapidly, and she starts to jerk as Valygar's own eyes start rolling in back of his head, and he whispers something deep under his breath.)~
@965  = ~(Almost as fast as the seizures set in, they slowly start to subside, and Valygar wearily rises to his feet, pulls his clothing around him, and he goes back to keeping a lookout for any possible danger.)~
@966  = ~Give her some air. She will be wanting water. Just give it to her in sips...~
@967  = ~(Slowly, Tashia stabilizes, and as she leans back weakly, she rasps out) You saved me... what... happened?!?~
@968  = ~You went into shock. Looks like you're allergic to bee stings.~
@969  = ~Shock? Allergic? I've been stung before. I've never... it felt like my whole body was on fire.~
@970  = ~Tashia, I know what I am speaking of. Some people are allergic to bees. It can kill, sometimes very quickly. I don't really know why, but I also know that sometimes people have been stung before with no problems, but one sting later...~
@971  = ~Valygar...~
@972  = ~If you are well enough to talk, well, then you are well enough to walk.~
@973  = ~(Sparing a few more glances, he softens slightly) Take a few more minutes...~
@974  = ~(Once the party gets moving again, Tashia strides up to his side, and she quietly says) Valygar, thank you...you saved my life.~
@975  = ~You're welcome, it was nothing. Now, can we get back to the trail?~
@976  = ~After you answer me one question...~
@977  = ~Hmm?~
@978  = ~I know you healed me, and I know how you feel about magic. So... why?~
@979  = ~First of all, its not magic. Well, it is, but it isn't. I mean, as a ranger, its not a major secret, but we are endowed with some minor abilities, no different than a cleric, really.~
@980  = ~Yes, but I still know how you feel about...~
@981  = ~Tashia, what will it take for you to drop this? Would it be so hard to believe that I don't hate all magic-users? Even I can slowly revise my opinions, but that doesn't mean I still don't think the temptation of power is too great for one to pursue magic, but neither will I let my comrades down.~
@982  = ~Okay, I will leave it be.~
@983  = ~Hey Yoshimo, I am curious. You're not from around here, are you?~
@984  = ~Indeed I am not, Tashia. Tell me, what gave it away? Was it my accent... or was it my swarthy, if rather handsome appearance? Maybe it was...~
@985  = ~(She laughs) Okay, okay... I kinda walked right into that one. Tell me, though, where are you from? I come from the lands of the Ten Towns, much further to the north. One thing I can say I don't honestly miss too much is the constant cold.~
@986  = ~A man in my line of work must be a bit careful who they tell information to... but you seem honest enough. Truth be known, I come from Kara-Tur.~
@987  = ~Kara-Tur? Funny, you don't sound how I would imagine one from Kara-Tur would sound like.~
@988  = ~Oh? And just how would you expect us to sound? Not all of us go around sounding like we are speaking in broken phrases like. If I went around saying things like:

Autumn winds dance in the sky
The leaves fall frosted with ice
The swallows return south

I could guarantee that half of my business would be cut as they waded through the swamp of my language.~
@989  = ~Yeah, heh. I guess I really should have given it some thought. But coming to Amn, isn't that a bit out of the ways to go to from Kara-Tur?~
@990  = ~Indeed it is. I spent many a night aboard ship, too many nights it felt like sometimes. Though I was glad to make landfall... as was the crew.~
@991  = ~Really? And why that would be?~
@992  = ~Oh, it had a little something to do with their gambling debts. Why, I bet that if I would have had one more week, I would have been the proud owner of a large, if smelly fishing trawler.~
@993  = ~And just what would you have done with that ship?~
@994  = ~I don't know. Maybe turn it into a riverboat gambler... one that reeks of dead fish.~
@995  = ~Hey Tashia, did you ever hear...~
@996  = ~Let me guess, Jan, this is going to be some pointless story about one of your myriad relatives. It shall go on and on, without any end in sight, involving some kind of small, vaguely round vegetable?~
@997  = ~Tashia, you cut me to the quick. Why, this story doesn't involve anything that you just said.~
@998  = ~Okay, Jan, what is it, then?~
@999  = ~As I was going to say, I was going to ask if you ever heard of my cousin Bjorn. Rather good with his hands, expert locksmith. Anyways, there was this king who was going off to war. Unsure how long he would be, and worried about the... fidelity of his new wife, he commissioned Bjorn to create a chastity belt.~
@1000 = ~Heh, as if that would stop a truly determined lady.~
@1001 = ~Normally, it wouldn't. However, I did say that Bjorn was an expert locksmith. When the king came to see Bjorn's creation, he was rather surprised to find a rather large hole in the most obvious of places. That which a chastity belt was meant to guard against.~
@1002 = ~Really? I would think that an opening at that... orifice would rather defeat the whole purpose of having the belt.~
@1003 = ~Indeed. But I did say that was Bjorn rather resourceful. Upon seeing the king's disbelief, Bjorn reached over the workbench for his lunch, and pulled out a rather large turnip. He slid the turnip into the gaping hole, which resulted in a whistle in the air, and a satisfying snick. Pulling his hand back, Bjorn showed that half of the turnip was cut clear in half, and pointing at the hole, revealed a rather sharp blade.~
@1004 = ~Ouch...~
@1005 = ~Certainly. Anyways, the king was well pleased with Bjorn's invention, and he doubled the salary he was paying my cousin. Of course, as he had no intention of paying him anything, Bjorn spent the next few years in the dungeon. Anyways, the king finally came back from his years at war and assembled his knights. He had them drop their drawers for an inspection, and much to his chagrin, everyone of them was mutilated in some fashion... all but one knight, his brother actually.~
@1006 = ~I think I see where this is going.~
@1007 = ~Oh yes. The king embraced his brother in a manly hug, pleased that at least one man was loyal to him. The king smiled, saying, 'Since you were the only one who kept faith with me, I shall reward you with anything you want. All you have to do is say what you want.' Several minutes passed, as his brother turned his head, and the king said, 'Come, come. No need to be bashful... all you have to do is give voice to it.~
@1008 = ~I should have seen this coming...~
@1009 = ~So the brother opens his mouth, and says, 'Ah-buh-buh-ah-buh-buh'~
@1010 = ~... Jan?~
@1011 = ~Yes, Tashia?~
@1012 = ~Go away.~
@1013 = ~(As the group travels along, Tashia notices that Nalia is a bit quiet, keeping her eyes to the ground, only raising them up when she senses the group makes a change in their direction.)~
@1014 = ~Hey Nalia, what's so interesting on the ground?~
@1015 = ~Oh, hi Tashia. No, there is nothing. Why do you ask?~
@1016 = ~No reason, really, just that you seem a bit preoccupied. I thought maybe you found a trail of breadcrumbs or something to follow.~
@1017 = ~Trail of bread... oh, that old story of the woodcutter's children putting down a trail of breadcrumbs to follow their way home. No, I was just thinking.~
@1018 = ~Thinking about what Isaea said? I won't deny that I wish matters had been settled more definitely, but I also know these things take time.~
@1019 = ~There is that. But that wasn't what I was thinking of, it's just... I don't think I can repay anyone for all that has happened.~
@1020 = ~What do you mean, repay?~
@1021 = ~Well, it was easy when you all defeated the trolls. After they were defeated, I gave you your gold as a reward. But you saving me from Isaea... I don't know that if there is any way I can pay you all back anytime soon.~
@1022 = ~Nalia... whoever said anything about paying us back?~
@1023 = ~What? Did I say something wrong? I'm sorry, but I guess you guys don't really know me all that well. But I do repay my debts.~
@1024 = ~I am sure that you do, Nalia. But this isn't about repaying debts, not like that.~
@1025 = ~What do you mean? Well, if you guys want something else, I could probably find something else. Sell a few heirlooms...~
@1026 = ~No, Nalia. We didn't do any of that because we expected recompense, we did that because we were friends. Well, I can't speak for any of the others, I guess... but I'm sure <CHARNAME> did it for the same reason I did: that we don't like something hurting our friends.~
@1027 = ~Friends?~
@1028 = ~Yes, Nalia, friends. Is that so hard to believe? I would like to think we are friends.~
@1029 = ~Friends... we are friends, aren't we?~
@1030 = ~Certainly.~
@1031 = ~Friends. I didn't really have friends, growing up that is. Oh, there was Baunchy and such, but he was really Father's friend. Aunty ruined any friends I might have made with the commoner kids, always going on a tirade about how I was ruining myself and Father. Well, I loved him of course... but ever since mother died, Father threw himself into his business more than anything else. And whatever Aunty wanted, he gave her, just to keep her out of earshot.~
@1032 = ~I'm sorry.~
@1033 = ~Don't say it. Don't say you're sorry when you had nothing to do with it.~
@1034 = ~But I know what you meant, and I thank you for it.~
@1035 = ~So, Tashia, what do friends tend to talk about?~
@1036 = ~Whatever comes to their mind actually. Heh, why I remember talking with my sister. You know that I had five siblings... we originally went traveling together. Anyways, she had this crush on the boy. I thought he was a bit slow myself, but I must admit, he was easy on the eyes...~
@1037 = ~Did you just growl, Viconia?~
@1038 = ~Not at you, iblith, but since you already had the temerity to broach on my thoughts, let me ask you this. How do you tolerate it?~
@1039 = ~Tolerate what? Your gripes and complaints? It isn't easy, but given enough time, even Ilmater would learn to tune you out.~
@1040 = ~I would have you flayed for such disrespect back home...~
@1041 = ~But you aren't back home.~
@1042 = ~And that is part of the problem...and a lesser concern. No, what I am asking is why you surface women allow men to continue with this nonsense of thinking they are even your equals, let alone your betters.~
@1043 = ~Hmm. I don't see it that way myself, not entirely. On the other hand, I know there are plenty of women who would agree with you.~
@1044 = ~Sounds like there may be sensible surfacers after all.~
@1045 = ~I know one who is fond of saying, 'Men are like fine wine. They start out as sweet as grapes, then women must stomp on them and keep them in the dark, until they mature into something nice to have dinner with.~
@1046 = ~Ah, she would have made a good drow, unlike simpering dolts like you. Males aren't worth much until properly broken in.~
@1047 = ~Perhaps. But I would have to disagree with you. What about love? What about trust? Your way... you may live, but it would be lonely.~
@1048 = ~L'alurl abbil zhah dosstan. The only one you can trust is yourself. Everything else is foolish sentimentality.~
@1049 = ~Yoshimo, would you say you are a good bounty hunter?~
@1050 = ~Good enough, for Yoshimo stands before you, does he not? He didn't die of starvation for losing his quarry, nor does he lie in some forgotten alley, a knife in his back.~
@1051 = ~Heh, ask a stupid question...~
@1052 = ~Was there a particular reason you asked me that question?~
@1053 = ~Actually, there was another one I wanted to ask, but was unsure how to phrase it. Ever since we've met, you seem confident of your abilities, and for good reason. I was just curious if there was a time or two when your quarry got the better of you.~
@1054 = ~You honor me with your praise, but you are right that not all my hunts have been successful. Take my fourth assignment... no, it was the fifth assignment as an example. I was hired to find someone who owed my principal a great deal of money.~
@1055 = ~I expect you probably had to chase him into the woods or something.~
@1056 = ~No, not really. You see, the man I was looking for actually worked a couple towns over as a tea-master at a local shrine. I pretended to make a social call on my quarry, and was invited to tea.~
@1057 = ~Invited to tea? Why would you be invited to tea?~
@1058 = ~It is a ceremony common to those parts, and no disrespect intended Tashia, the significance of which may be lost on you. As I said, I was invited to tea. Little did I know how proficient my quarry was at his craft. Upon my entrance, the tea-master knew something was amiss, and politely asked me to leave my sword outside for the ceremony.~
@1059 = ~I gather it didn't exactly go down that way? Let me guess, you refused and then there was one splattered tea-master lying on the ground of the shrine.~
@1060 = ~You rush the tale, but no, events didn't unfold the way you surmised. You were correct in assuming I kept my sword by my side. As I explained to the tea-master, I was a warrior, and would never be parted from my blade. The tea-master nodded sagely, and invited me in, sword and all. The tea pot started to whistle...and the tea-master suddenly tipped it over. Hissing steam rose and filled the room with smoke and ashes.~
@1061 = ~And the tea-master ducked out in the ensuing clamor?~
@1062 = ~That was my first thought. So I ran outside to find him--only to find he wasn't there, nor was my sword. Turning around, I saw the tea-master still in the teahouse. He bowed before me, and said, 'It was my mistake. Come back in and have some tea. I have your sword covered with ashes, and will clean it and give it back to you.'~
@1063 = ~So what did you do afterwards?~
@1064 = ~There was little else I could do, but go back and enjoy my tea.~
@1065 = ~(sigh)~
@1066 = ~What's wrong, Tashia?~
@1067 = ~Oh, it's nothing. Melancholy mostly. Nothing serious.~
@1068 = ~Are you sure? We can talk about it if you wish.~
@1069 = ~Well, it's just that today was my stepmother's birthday. She took us in, my stepbrothers and stepsisters, I mean. Heh, of course, it used to drive me nuts trying to find a gift that she didn't already have, or one my siblings got for her.~
@1070 = ~Heh, I know the feeling. It wasn't much different back at Candlekeep. Why, on Gorion's birthday... no, maybe it would be better not to say anything.~
@1071 = ~You already mentioned it, Imoen. You can't hold back now.~
@1072 = ~I guess I can't, at that. Well, you have to understand, there weren't very many children at Candlekeep, and so we were under the care of various researchers and teachers. As a result, we didn't exactly have much leeway in gifts.~
@1073 = ~I can see where that would be a problem.~
@1074 = ~You don't know the half of it. Anyways, it was Gorion's birthday, and it was a big to do. One kid, he was studying under the priest of Oghma, brought forth a box, and Gorion shook it, saying, 'I know what it is. I bet it is a book.' The boy said, 'That's right'. Then one of the scullery maids came with a box, and Gorion held it up, and said, 'I bet I know what it is. Is it candy?' 'That's right' said the maid.~
@1075 = ~And then it was your turn?~
@1076 = ~Yes, it was. Anyways, I gave my box to Gorion, and he noticed it was leaking. He touched a drop with his finger and tasted it. 'I bet I know what it is,' he said, 'is it wine?~
@1077 = ~Wine?~
@1078 = ~Well, I was staying with Winthrop at the time. He was the innkeeper at Candlekeep, as well as the chief bartender.~
@1079 = ~Which is why Gorion would guess there was wine in it.~
@1080 = ~Except that it wasn't wine. Imagine Gorion's surprise when he found a puppy within.~
@1081 = ~Stop it!~
@1082 = ~Stop what?~
@1083 = ~Yer getting that beetle-like look on yer bleeding face, pointy-ears, and I don't like it.~
@1084 = ~By the gods, I have no idea what you are babbling about, Korgan.~
@1085 = ~Ye don't? I donnae believe you. Every time yer ears twitch, and yer face scrunches up like a used up dish rag, ye then have to spout off yer latest riddle or some other twaddle.~
@1086 = ~Well, I hate to disappoint you, gritsucker, but I wasn't thinking about that. Truth be known, I was thinking of someone else... someone you reminded me of.~
@1087 = ~And who would this poor sod be?~
@1088 = ~Ever heard of Gordian Knotbreaker? He lived a long time ago, but was considered one of the greatest riddle solvers ever lived.~
@1089 = ~I told ye that I dinnae want to hear clap-trap on any riddles.~
@1090 = ~And you won't, not really. You see, he lived in a time when his country was engulfed by ruin and revolt. The high king had died, and no legitimate heir had been found. In despair, the priests prayed with all their might for an answer to their problems.~
@1091 = ~Yer boring me, girlie, and I still be needing to sharpen me axe. Perhaps I will use yer skull.~
@1092 = ~The next morning, a massive knot was found on the altar along with a scroll saying that whoever could undo the knot was the rightful ruler.~
@1093 = ~Picking a king by whoever could undo a knot? Ye got to be joking.~
@1094 = ~That was the way it was, though. So everyone came to try and untie the knot. They found no end to the knot so they could untie it, and magic proved ineffective. Not until Gordian came up, you see. He spat in his hands, picked up his axe...~
@1095 = ~And cut the priests off at the knees?~
@1096 = ~And cut the knot in half, thereby becoming king.~
@1097 = ~Finally, someone who didn't have his head up his bloody arse!~
@1098 = ~Well, sometimes the best solution is the direct one.~
@1099 = ~Cernd, are there any civilized comforts you miss since you've become a druid?~
@1100 = ~My needs are few and far between. If I am hungry, I can either hunt something down, or go gathering plants. I never feel lonely, for all of nature's creatures are there to keep me company.~
@1101 = ~But needs aren't the same as comforts, are they?~
@1102 = ~No, they are not. I admit there are a couple things that I do miss.~
@1103 = ~Such as?~
@1104 = ~(runs a hand along his cheek) Mirrors for one. Razors for another. Do you know how hard it is to keep oneself clean shaven when you only have your reflection in a pond, and a scimitar or dull knife to scrape away the hair?~
@1105 = ~Ugh, I can see where that would be a problem. Not to mention all the blood...~
@1106 = ~Well, I looked more like a wounded boar after the first time I shaved. The...wound...was attended to, but the healer was tempted to leave it be as an object lesson. Still, it was better than the alternative.~
@1107 = ~Alternative?~
@1108 = ~There was another druidess who said she found a way to keep hair from growing entirely.~
@1109 = ~I hope it didn't involved any kind of potions or creams. My step-father, in a moment of vanity, bought an elixir from a traveling gnome one time. His hair grew alright, but it was the hair between his ears.~
@1110 = ~No, it was nothing like that. No, the druidess said by applying a light electrical jolt to a region a certain number of times, it would kill the hair that grew there, keeping it smooth all year round.~
@1111 = ~Ouch. Surely no one was stupid enough to get it done.~
@1112 = ~Not to my knowledge, no.~
@1113 = ~So Haer'Dalis, did you practice much to become the man mothers warn their daughters of, or does it come naturally?~
@1114 = ~You cut me to the quick with such an unwarranted jab. Why the hostility?~
@1115 = ~Excuse me, then. It's just that you remind me of my... former leman.~
@1116 = ~At least it is nice to know the resentment you harbor isn't entirely of my making. Still, I am curious, what is it about my manner that sets you most at unease?~
@1117 = ~If you really want to know, it is your silver tongue.~
@1118 = ~Then I think I see the problem. You were but an innocent maid, when your beau came into your life, and spoke honeyed words.~
@1119 = ~(whispers) Your lips are like red wine, I should like to drink from them.~
@1120 = ~Your eyes are like sparkling pools, I should like to bathe in their beauty.~
@1121 = ~See what I mean?!? You even know the exact same lines.~
@1122 = ~If it is any solace, Tashia, know that the lines aren't that original. Your erstwhile paramour would have taken them from another source. Why, I can easily think of at least three major works in which those lines are quoted.~
@1123 = ~And I guess you could have come up with something better?~
@1124 = ~Well, it perforce would depend on my intent. As I have come to know you, I would know to appeal to your intellect, that part of you which enjoys riddles and wordplay, as well as appeal to your sense of joy. For example, if I was to recast the line, I might have said something along the lines of...~
@1125 = ~Your lips are like red wine, I should like to drink from them. Your eyes are like sparkling pools, I should like to bathe in their beauty. Your hair is like a field of golden wheat, I should like to cut it, thresh it, and bake it into muffins.~
@1126 = ~(laughs slightly) Silver tongue and a rapier wit, especially to bring me out of my mood. You are a dangerous man, Haer'Dalis.~
@1127 = ~One must play to one's audience, my swan.~
@1128 = ~Jan, where did your family get its green thumb?~
@1129 = ~You know about that, Tashia?~
@1130 = ~I think everyone back in Amn knows about it.~
@1131 = ~I knew that cousin Norvik couldn't be trusted. Get a little turnip juice into him, and he starts to run at the mouth. I swear, we didn't mean for gangrene to set in, but once it did, we couldn't throw it out. Waste not, want not...~
@1132 = ~Jan, what in the nine hells are you rambling about? I was talking about the tree you and your family lives in. I mean, the plant was still alive.~
@1133 = ~Oh, that. Well, it only requires a little TLC.~
@1134 = ~TLC?~
@1135 = ~Turnip, love, and care.~
@1136 = ~I should have known. I should have known.~
@1137 = ~You didn't strike me as the gardening type, Tashia. Look at those nails, they are more suitable for gouging out eyes than they are for digging up tubers. Now, turnip stroker... yes, you definitely would have a future there.~
@1138 = ~Turnip... stroker?~
@1139 = ~To achieve maximum growth...~
@1140 = ~Enough, I don't want to know anymore.~
@1141 = ~But you are the one that brought the subject up!~
@1142 = ~No... no I didn't! Whatever. Sheesh, all I wanted to know was how you got your plants to grow so well. That way, when I got back to the Ten Towns, I could tell my mother. She loves to garden, and is always looking for an edge.~
@1143 = ~Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? There is no secret. For tomatoes, it's best to expose yourself to them at least twice a day.~
@1144 = ~Expose... yourself?~
@1145 = ~Certainly. That way they turn red of embarrassment. Though I must warn you to be careful around cucumbers. My father did it, and quadrupled their size within the season.~
@1146 = ~Tashia, is everything alright?~
@1147 = ~What? Yes, yes everything is alright Aerie.~
@1148 = ~Are you sure? You seemed...preoccupied.~
@1149 = ~I...I will be fine Aerie. I was just thinking. Thinking and remembering.~
@1150 = ~About Arilistan?~
@1151 = ~I must have been talking in my sleep again, but yes, I was thinking about him.~
@1152 = ~If he brought you such pain, why do you think of him?~
@1153 = ~He was my first love, Aerie. That is something a woman never forgets. A person can have many loves, but the first one is always special, though not always in a good way.~
@1154 = ~If...if it would help, you can always talk to me.~
@1155 = ~I appreciate the offer Aerie, but this is something I'm going to have to muddle through on my own.~
@1156 = ~Okay Tashia, I will leave you be. However, even I know the hurts of the soul, the head, the heart can be more dangerous than the wounds of the body.~
@1157 = ~(she hugs Aerie) You're a good friend, Aerie. When...when I'm ready, I will tell you.~
@1158 = ~So, how did you do it Keldorn? How did you manage to stay married for so many years?~
@1159 = ~There is no secret, Tashia. Maria and I never went to bed angry.~
@1160 = ~That's it? Surely you had to have fights and arguments.~
@1161 = ~Aye, we did, but we always made up before going to bed. Of course, all was not always this way.~
@1162 = ~Oh?~
@1163 = ~I remember one particularly horrible argument, and we ended up not speaking to each other. It is childish in retrospect, but who said youth was ever level-headed? I had to wake early the next day, and not wanting to break the silence, I wrote a note to Maria: 'Please wake me at seven bells'.~
@1164 = ~You really wanted to win bad, didn't you?~
@1165 = ~Aye, that I did. Let's just say, I learned several things that night. First, sometimes it is better to concede than press a point. Second, Maria is more patient than I ever could be.~
@1166 = ~What happened?~
@1167 = ~I woke with the sun shining in my face and the sound of nine bells echoing in my ears. Furious, I jumped out of bed, ready to break my silence--only to see a piece of paper flutter off the bed.~
@1168 = ~Teehee, I think I like the way Maria thinks.~
@1169 = ~As you guessed, Maria wrote, 'It's seven bells. It's time to wake up' on the slip of paper.~
@1170 = ~(hums)Golden slumber kiss your eyes, smiles await you when you rise.
Sleep, do not cry, and I'll sing you a lullaby.~
@1171 = ~Tashia, please stop...~
@1172 = ~Care you know not, therefore sleep, while I o'er you watch do keep...~
@1173 = ~Damn it, stop it, Tashia!~
@1174 = ~What? What's wrong, Anomen?~
@1175 = ~That song! Why were you humming that song?~
@1176 = ~I was just thinking of my sister. She...she used to like that song. Mother used to sing it to her before bed.~
@1177 = ~Used to?~
@1178 = ~She...she died of the pox. I...I held her hand as she went to sleep. Mother cradled her...~
@1179 = ~Shh. It's alright. Tashia. Please forgive my outburst. Go ahead, and sing it. I shall keep silent.~
@1180 = ~Are you sure? I mean, you were really angry--~
@1181 = ~Proceed as you will. Maybe, someday, I will tell you of the gentlest, kindest woman I've known.~
@1182 = ~Looks like your... friend is going to be a while. The name is Aimilona Goldmantle, I'm partners with yon shopkeeper. He attends to the clothing, while the armor is my purview.~
@1183 = ~You have the look of adventurers about you, so I know your kind normally doesn't go in for such fripperies as these. However, if you are of an interest, I may have something that might strike your fancy.~
@1184 = ~(Aimilona points toward a rack where there is a white garment hanging on a rack. As you come closer to examine it, you see that it is in fact a snow-white fur, the pelt unblemished by any other color, the front legs of it forming a neck clasp, an untarnished cloak.)~
@1185 = ~It came from a winter wolf. (She lifts an edge of the pelt, beckoning you to touch it. As your hand explores the fur, you find that the pelt is among the softest materials you've ever touched.)~
@1186 = ~Handworked... took about a month to soften. However, care was also taken to retain its resistance to the chill... definitely waterproof. Normally it would go for... 15,000 gold pieces... but it would stay here until the winter, and I would prefer to have the free space. I can let it go for as cheap as 12,000 gold pieces.~
@1187 = ~Hmm. It is an excellent cape, I will grant you, but that is a large amount of funds to come up with on a moment's notice, and who knows when I will be back this way. Tell you what, I will give you 10,000 gold pieces.~
@1188 = ~Well, that is a lot of money, but Tashia is worth every gold piece. Aimilona, you have a deal.~
@1189 = ~I'm sorry, friend, but that is much too high. I'm afraid I'm unable to pay for that amount now.~
@1190 = ~I'm sorry, but I can't go any lower than my initial offer. Take it or leave it...~
@1191 = ~All right then, I'll take it.~
@1192 = ~Sorry, I can't afford that.~
@1193 = ~It's good doing business with you, sir. I hope you enjoy the cloak.~
@1194 = ~By the way, if in the future you would like additional adornment, I am quite capable of enhancing the original. It didn't make sense to do so if no one was going to purchase it, but I am more than willing to work further on it... just bring me the proper materials, and for a price, it will be better than new.~
@1195 = ~Well, if you change your mind, it will be here for a bit longer, but I can make no guarantee that it will be here.~
@1196 = ~Welcome back, good sir! So, have you changed your mind about the pelt? Still a steal at the reasonable price of 12,000 gold pieces.~
@1197 = ~Not today. I'm just passing through.~
@1198 = ~That's why I'm here. Here's your money.~
@1199 = ~12,000 gold is still too high for a scrap of skin.~
@1200 = ~I'm sorry, but I can't go any lower than my initial offer. Take it or leave it.~
@1201 = ~It's good doing business with you, sir. I hope you enjoy the cloak. Also, I would be remiss in mentioning that if you are so inclined, we can include additional fripperies which improve on the base cape. Available for a modest fee, of course.~
@1202 = ~Very well, I shall put it back. If you return this way, it may still be here. However, I can guarantee that as the colder months come closer, it will be gone.~
@1203 = ~Welcome back, good sir! I trust there is nothing wrong with your purchase? Maybe it slipped my mind at the time, but all sales are final.~
@1204 = ~I didn't mean to come back here.~
@1205 = ~You mentioned something about improving the cloak?~
@1206 = ~Ah, you just took a wrong turn. It happens to the best of us. Why, when the road of life seems to be just one off-beaten path by another, sometimes it takes something special to set it straight. Let me tell you about a book that changed my life, my friend...~
@1207 = ~Indeed I did. Truth be known, what you possess is actually the lower end, more affordable winter cloak. Some of our more upper-scale clientele, however, demand accoutrement more befitting of their status. You will find that after our treatment of the fur, it offers the same protection as light armor, but is still as soft and pliable to the touch. Not only that, but the wearer of such a garment finds the cloak has captured the very touch of winter in its folds--which can be released at a later point.~
@1208 = ~Of course, the craftsmanship involved in creating such an item is such that we can only make it when the proper buyer gives proper payment. However, for the low price of 30,000 gold, you can own the Winter Cloak. I must warn you, though, due to the labor and materials involved, we can't haggle on the price.~
@1209 = ~No price is too high. I will get it.~
@1210 = ~30,000 gold? That's too rich for my blood.~
@1211 = ~Are you sure there is no way to lower the price?~
@1212 = ~Very good, sir. That is an attitude I can approve of. Here is your cloak. If by chance you find the enchantments failing, you can bring it back within thirty days for a refund.~
@1213 = ~I'm sorry to hear you think the price is too high. I bid you good day. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.~
@1214 = ~I apologize sir, but as mentioned, the cost can't be haggled down. The interplay of spells, as well as the raw cost of materials, and not to mention our resident enchanter's fees put it out of the range of all but the wealthiest of clients.~
@1215 = ~However, you also appear to be of an adventuring sort, so there just may be a way to defray the cost. We can't ignore our enchanter's costs, but if you could acquire the raw materials, you would find the costs definitely lessened... say, around the neighborhood of 7,500 gold pieces.~
@1216 = ~See, to guarantee the required amount of defense, the most basic amulet of protection is used in the making of the cloak. Additionally, the cloak gains its cone of cold capabilities through the sacrifice of a wand of frost. To channel all the magical energies properly, we use a perfectly cut diamond.~
@1217 = ~I will have to return when I find all you're looking for.~
@1218 = ~What do you know, I already have them.~
@1219 = ~I wish you luck on your quest then. Remember, you can always pay the extra amount if your searching doesn't yield the desired items.~
@1220 = ~Very, very good. I will just take those items from you, and we shall see about getting your enhanced cape back to you.~
@1221 = ~Another return visit? I must say I'm flattered, but I hope you realize that I'm already spoken for. Or are you back here on business?~
@1222 = ~I didn't mean to come here.~
@1223 = ~I have the money to buy the improvement of the cloak.~
@1224 = ~Well, I got everything you wanted.~
@1225 = ~Good day, sir. I hope you are enjoying your purchase.~
@1226 = ~(The shopkeeper runs a hand through his hair, a pleasant smile on his face) It was an honor to be outbid by m'lady. But I won't deny I hope it will be some time before you come this way again. My family needs to eat, after all...~
@1227 = ~You have taken too much already! You will return both Imoen's soul and Tashia!~
@1228 = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Tashia and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@1229 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Tashia alone. She is very important to me.~
@1230 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment. The theft of Tashia will not save you.~
@1231 = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure her fate will still serve as an example.~
@1232 = ~Here she is, though I doubt your fumbling could inspire the loyalty I take with a bite and a gaze. For all her words, her will was easier to break than a child's, as if craving the undeath in my touch.~
@1233 = ~You see? She's not even fully turned, but she is mine to command, and will obey when I send her against you now!~
@1234 = ~Yes, mistress... whatever you say.~
@1235 = ~Consider the needs of young Tashia here. It is so hard on your couples when you are separated.~
@1236 = ~I wasn't thinking of you losing him. This is a lesson, <CHARNAME>. Follow me and you will lose more than you could imagine. Starting now!~
@1237 = ~I have already lost one close to me, I refuse to lose another! When I am done with you, I shall scatter your ashes to the winds!~
@1238 = ~Is... is that you, <CHARNAME>? I...I was drowning in a tide of blood. I tried to scream, but the blood just flowed down my throat. I...I don't remember much except for the darkness that followed.~
@1239 = ~(She rushes toward you, wrapping her arms tightly around your body.)~
@1240 = ~I...I died again, didn't I? Twice...twice dead. And you saved me again. If...if I ever had any doubts about how you feel about me, they have been laid to rest.~
@1241 = ~Tashia, you won't get rid of me that easily.~
@1242 = ~Let's try to make sure third time isn't the charm, my love.~
@1243 = ~This is getting to be a habit, Tashia. I refuse to save you any more.~
@1244 = ~I don't think we can stay together, Tashia. Just being near me puts you in danger.~
@1245 = ~(Tashia gives a firm kiss on your cheek, and squeezes your hand) And I thank the gods for that.~
@1246 = ~(Tashia smiles wanly, though there is no humor in it) I know you were just trying to ease my despair, but pardon me if I don't laugh.~
@1247 = ~(Tashia's eyes open wide, and a look of hurt and anger floods her face. She reaches up, and smacks you hard, knocking you to the ground as magic augments her hand.)~
@1248 = ~You bastard! How could you say such a hateful thing? It's not like I planned this! Well, if that is how you feel about it, then I will spare you from worrying about me any further.~
@1249 = ~(Tashia's eyes widen, and a look of panic twists her features) That...that is a risk I'm willing to take! Please...please don't let the danger drive us apart.~
@1250 = ~Are you sure you wish to be with me?~
@1251 = ~I can't take that risk.~
@1252 = ~(Tashia's right hand locks desperately on your forearm, and when she speaks, it sounds like she has a sob caught in her throat.)~
@1253 = ~There will always be danger, <CHARNAME>. Even if you weren't a Bhaalspawn, an adventurer's life is far from safe. You could be the next one to die, not me. That is a danger we face...together.~
@1254 = ~(Tashia stiffens, and she steps away. When she speaks, her voice could freeze water.)~
@1255 = ~Then I shall spare your emotions. We shall be as strangers from this day forth.~
@1256 = ~Elhan!  I've the half vampire body of Tashia here because of you!  You'll tell me now!~
@1257 = ~A friend is afflicted by vampirism.  An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know something about that.~
@1258 = ~Have you come seeking wisdom from the Binder of What is Known? The Wise God stands ready.~
@1259 = ~No, thank you, I have no need of help at the moment.~
@1260 = ~I lost a loved one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.  I seek a means of curing her.~
@1261 = ~A loved one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find them?~
@1262 = ~Someone I care about has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save them?~
